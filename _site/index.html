      Increase satisfaction and ease of use when interacting with a refrigerator. Basically, we need to improve the design and functionalities of the refrigerator to make it more user-friendly, easy to use and feature rich to satisfy our customers. To achieve this goal, we have to hear what our customers and stakeholders are looking for in a good solution.

      Surveys conducted are anonymous, only type of user (home, working, etc.) is askedOur scope is limited to the interaction with the refrigerator; very less or no consideration is given to the environment in which refrigerator is being used.Survey and Interview sample size is 20-25 peoples having different level of interactions and use cases with the refrigerator. We assumed this sample size is enough for our scope.We are assuming that we are doing all these exercises to improve a business position in the market. &nbsp;

    <td>
      The main pain areas resulting from user interviews, contextual observations, surveys &nbsp;with the refrigerator use are: The refrigerator is not modular and doesn’t suit the containers if they are very large or small.Very painful to every time open the door just to see what is there inside and control the temperature.Very difficult to move from one place to other to clean it or floor under it.Almost all the participants wanted some indication in a display like temperature, capacity, odor level etc. The other interesting finding is that customers like their brands with their heart and would not like to switch to different brand if purchasing a new refrigerator but can reconsider their decision if reliability in the form of warranty is provided.

    <td>
      The main findings are that user (voice of almost all users) wants to save the time while interacting with and using the refrigerator. He wants nearly everything to be automated, handy, and easy to use with low learning curve. We have suggested few design changes and inclusion of new technologies like electronic nose to detect odor in the refrigerator and alarming, use of LEDs for saving power and providing uniform lighting, inverter technology of using the compressor heat to efficiently convert back to electric power and demand based power usage. Proposed Recommendations: Provision of giving settings controls and LCD/LED display outside the refrigerator so the user needs not to open the door and bend every time just to check or change the temperature, see inside the refrigerator.Transparent Walls with reversible opaque capability. Person with the press of switch or remote can switch between transparent exterior and opaque exterior.Modular design &nbsp; &nbsp;

One day, a curious kid was asking question after seeing Jupiter in the early hours that where this Jupiter is gone now, why we can’t see it. I was enthralled and at the same time happy to see such curiosity. This is what differentiate us from animals.<br />
Then I thought, is this question valid in space particularly if we are standing on the moon? It becomes more interesting when moon come into the picture. So this question can be divided into two parts.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>
    A few years back, teachers used to feel happy to go to seniors (head/principal) and talk openly about the problems they were facing, but now it is very difficult to think and do. Now, we live in a situation in schools in which people and the idea of collaboration are slowly disappearing.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Teaching is about learning and developing certain skills, certain competencies and keeping certain strategies at your disposal. Without empathy and considerations about social economic backgrounds of students, these competencies become very unhelpful for teachers and it produces a very limited idea of what teaching is.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    But without questions, there are going to be no answers. And so the importance of asking questions is being recognized and a lot more now. We always remember a teacher who has touched us in some way. For a good teacher, children think he is one of them and one of us too. Teaching isn&#8217;t just about certain skills, competencies, strategies, etc., there&#8217;s something else that is also required.
  </p>
  
  <h4>
    Reflective Practice
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    Reflection practice challenges assumptions that we bring with us into teaching and it questions us how we should do things differently in a better way. It reinforces our belief in what we do. Challenging our assumption is very difficult thing to do because we don&#8217;t know what our assumptions are and that&#8217;s the reason they&#8217;re called assumptions.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    During our lifetime we develop certain mental frameworks &#8211; ways of understanding the world, experiencing the world. new experiences, new information. Instead of changing the way we look at the world, we try to manipulate this new experience to challenge it. We try to manipulate it in such a way that we can fit it into our existing understandings. You know, I think we all understand how, how we do this. and, you know, these are our assumptions.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If we don&#8217;t challenge our assumptions, we would always just stay the way that we are and nothing grows with us.
  </p>
  
  <h4>
    Reflexive teaching
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    Reflexivity encourages us to understand our practice in relation to the society/the world in which we live. We should understand how our students socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds have an impact on how they experience schooling.  It is not about thinking just ourselves in isolation, about our personal qualities, our competencies, it&#8217;s about developing an understanding of the impact of students lives outside of school, on the way they are and the way they learn inside the school. It would include, for example, understanding the impact of emotions on students.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Understanding behavior more in terms of what happens outside of school and developing appropriate ways of dealing with not just dismissing someone&#8217;s behavior as bad, or unacceptable. We may feel we need to punish bad behavior but teaching is about trying to understand it in terms of a student&#8217;s wider life. We cannot just treat our emotions as things that we can just dump any place conveniently. We carry them with us all the time, we are humans.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The most important thing we&#8217;re encouraged to leave out the classroom or interaction our feelings &#8211; Teachers are not supposed to have feelings. This is wrong. We need to support our kids emotionally by understanding why they are behaving in a particular manner by asking questions so that they can explain.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We need to be an ear to them who don&#8217;t ignore them and listen to them with embrace and compassion.

How it is that possible that light (bulb/source put in place of WiFi router) not entering those areas. See the embedded video for a wonderful tour of the quest to answer. These both radiations are part of the electromagnetic spectrum but still behave differently. Is it increasing your curiosity level, let’s dive in… TV, mobile, WiFi all use transmitted radio waves and convert them to mechanical vibrations in the speaker to create sound waves that can be heard.</p>
