Previous months have been quite busy, hence we couldn&#8217;t post for long time. Now, we are back with a bang of fresh energy.  
In the past many days, we conducted many experiments from building small microscope at home to understanding optics, etc., we will share the details of how to build these things in coming weeks.  
As of now, you can access all our media of experiments that we do using Microscope, Binocular, Telescope, and Camera at http://sciloo.com/experiments_media/

Please share your experience with this media and post your open questions to us, we will be glad to assist you.
