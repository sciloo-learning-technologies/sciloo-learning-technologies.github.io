<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stargazing is the best part of our workshop. Kids were invited along with parents to share their joy and aha moments. Every child enjoyed the observation of stars and planets. They observed the craters and the surface of the moon. Some planets like Jupiter and moon of Jupiter were shown to the kids and their parents. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Their excitement and rain of questions and discussions about the earth, the sun, and the universe gave us the happiness we always look for &#8211; the pleasure of finding things out and observing.</span>
