## I want to start selling T-shirts. Where do I begin?

I will recommend you to you start a business where less competition is present and you have the pricing power. You need to be clear why you want to start specifically Tshirt business. There is a huge competition in clothing, you will really need to think about scaling your business and margins. 
If you still want to start it. First remember start small. Have some design for the target audience (select gender age etc.). You should be clear who is your user/consumer. Then contact manufacturers who can make your design (fabric types/quality, gsm, print). They can ask you for huge minimum quantity for the order but initially verify your business don’t go for margins but plan to be profitable. You need to think where you will store and how you will ship. We do it via amazon. you can search sciloo on

 - start small
 - test your idea (may be if you can get 5–10 samples, quickly try to sell online)
 - build brand by satisfying customers
 - sell the vision not cloth (customer should associate to your idea)
