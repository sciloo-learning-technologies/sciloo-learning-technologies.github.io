When we buy a product, mostly we first focus on
	use
	then price
	then brand
	mostly forget safety
	
	People focus mostly on the price and use.
	
	You get a product that may work
	but will it work as desired over a long period of time safely.
	
	if you have focussed on money not the quality then the product can be risky and the money you used to buy it can become wasted.
	
You should have focussed about the use, safety, brand and price.
why brand is more imp than price
	we need to understand what is a brand first.
		brand is a company name or name of a product range which get	
		famous because
			it is made with high quality materials
			made with established processes
			has safety of the customers in mind 
			has been tested in different conditions over a long period of time
				it gives it reliablity and safety.
			They give warranty which can be relied upon in real life.
		local brands may not have these because they are just selling products not disclosing the processes, not disclosing whether they actually made or designed the product or just relabel a chinese or local made item with their logo.
		
I give you a example
	If you want to buy a good headphone
		will you buy a local headphone if you your use is very high quality music with comfort
		or you will go with bose.
			You should go with bose, reason is they have mastered the sound and comfort for the listener.
		same for a mixer grinder will you buy a philips one or a local one.
			I recommend philips because they are leaders in the field and do good amount of research on each product they make.

I request you to provide your experiences in buying a branded or unbranded product.
		
I don't recommed you to buy new products as you should save money, invest money for your financial independence.
You should buy used products but don't buy used electronics and high value products from unknowns or without written quarantees because trust is missing.
Anything that you can inspect and validate you can buy used.
