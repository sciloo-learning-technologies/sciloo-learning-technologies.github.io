See the amazing behaviour of the ball with the blower. The air coming from the blower is normally at constant pressure and for round objects, this creates a floating environment which is unbelievable.

The interesting point is if the ball is light and you push it away or sideways it doesn&#8217;t fall but wobbles in a complex path. This is difficult to believe. Kids will love it and you will be busy finding the answer.

&nbsp;



We will be posting videos with different round objects later after experimenting with them. We will also try to build one airplane to see how it behaves.

Please comment the reason of this behaviour.
