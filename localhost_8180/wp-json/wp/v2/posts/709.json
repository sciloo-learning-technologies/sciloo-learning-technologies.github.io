Also ask, why is it night in India when it&#8217;s day in the USA. You&#8217;ll expose them to some very basic scientific fundamentals that you can build on.\u00a0Kids can come up with totally weird answers and\u00a0we tend to correct them with the right answers.\u00a0Rather we should ask them where did they get the answer from, how did they think about it?\u00a0If you keep feeding them right answers you might never know what is wrong in their thinking process and how they arrive at a particular answer.<\/p>\n<h4>Big picture and Feedback<\/h4>\n<p>As parents, we should show them the bigger picture\u00a0to make them understand what&#8217;s going on here.\u00a0It is a very critical piece in their life and growth as they might not connect with the bigger picture when they are doing something. It can affect their interest and motivation.<\/p>\n<p>Another very important area where the parents must be involved all the time is feedback.\u00a0What kind of feedback do you give? Most of the time it\u00a0empty and useless feedback.\u00a0Feedback should be very specific and task focussed and should produce a set of corrective actions.<\/p>\n<p>See the sports coaches, they diagnose whatever the particular sportsperson is doing well and not doing well and then focuses in on the things they need to improve.\u00a0The importance of the big picture and growth in a skill are very critical aspects of feedback.<\/p>\n<p>Help kids in know what are they doing, why are they doing and how they can make sense of it.\u00a0It&#8217;s kind of chess board game,\u00a0If you know the rules of the game, if you can spot the patterns, you&#8217;ve got\u00a0a much more powerful memory than if all you&#8217;re trying to remember a few pieces and games that you already played.<\/p>\n<h4>Imagination<\/h4>\n<p>Help them imagine what will it be like if they are successful (doing something they love and want to do)?\u00a0Many successful people imagine themselves doing things and dreaming about achieving the goals and the life they want to have, coach the kids with this principle &#8211; imagining, believing, working and achieving.<\/p>\n<h4>Ability or disability induction<\/h4>\n<p>Don&#8217;t focus on the word or rather forget the word &#8211; ability, rather work with kind of apprenticeship model, where you talk about\u00a0somebody being naive, novice, apprentice, expert, master as they learn, do, and progress.<\/p>\n<p>Life is a learning process,\u00a0it is about the work itself not about the kid.\u00a0Ability is all about reputations, labels, and\u00a0that really interferes with how teachers and schools treat kids. The biggest difference between a good teacher and a normal teacher\u00a0is the level of the cognitive demand of the work they set their kids, all the kids.<\/p>\n<p>Expert\/good teachers expect more from all of their kids, not just the bright ones. They expect them to do deep learning work which is understanding themselves, making sense of it for\u00a0themselves.\u00a0So stay away from the word ability and\u00a0demand more of our children, all the children.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re told that you are high ability or low ability,\u00a0It doesn\u2019t take you far for certainly.\u00a0But\u00a0If you are told that you can do something well or\u00a0you can do something better,\u00a0it gives you a lot of possibilities and opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>By putting kids into ability groups is very harmful, kids at the top get the more imaginative, better, more creative and\u00a0kids at the bottom are treated as they&#8217;re not going to do well. Kids at the bottom are event told that you are less capable and not in the same league. The\u00a0gap widens with time and distorts the thinking process and confidence of kids. It is like\u00a0we are writing a script for them at that point about what they can and\u00a0can&#8217;t do without really testing it out, without really giving them opportunities, without understanding them.<\/p>\n<p>Kids (ours and others) are like flowers and nature, each has its own beauty and variations, we should nurture it rather than segregating them and damaging them to the core.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Build on &#8211; expose the world to them Find out what your child actually knows and\u00a0understands, rather than assuming.\u00a0Asking them good questions\u00a0would expose many misconceptions and misunderstandings about the world to them.\u00a0Imagine with little older kids, if we&#8217;re talking about the earth rotation, its orbit,\u00a0our solar system, they can tell us what is earth and&hellip; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/2017\/06\/27\/parenting-for-better-learnings\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Parenting for better learnings<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2,193,192,232],"tags":[219,57,200],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/709"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=709"}],"version-history":[{"count":8,"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/709\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":732,"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/709\/revisions\/732"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=709"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=709"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=709"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
