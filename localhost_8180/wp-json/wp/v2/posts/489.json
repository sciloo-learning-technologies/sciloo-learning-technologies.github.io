It takes you to the top and brings down many times and you feel\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">both happy and sad. Nothing is permanent as we are Human.

You are broken, but is it really so? Ask yourself. Are you broken or you are confused about yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Story of Value &#8211; you are winner until you loose<\/h4>\n<p>In a small distant town, there was a seminar going on where a huge number of people were gathered. It was not a formal seminar but a kind of social gathering and discussion. The gentleman on the stage start waving a 1000 Rs note and started asking the public who wants it. Not a surprise, nearly everybody wanted that note as it was coming free with no strings attached.<\/p>\n<p>Then the person crumbled the note in his hands and again asked the same question &#8211; Who wants it now? Again, everybody raised their hands and public were about to push each other, everybody thinking they will get it.<\/p>\n<p>Then to the surprise of all, the person took the notes and put it underneath his shoes and crushed it badly in dust. It became soiled and crumbled when he showed it to all. Here he comes again, Who wants it now? This time though not everybody but many people still wanted that note.<\/p>\n<p>The person in charge\u00a0of the note broke into a big laughter and then became sad with a slow body movement. He started speaking, you have seen today the value of this note, but I wanted to tell you something else with this story. I want to show your value to you all.<\/p>\n<p>You and me are like this note, broken and stressed by Life many times over and over. You think that nobody wants you and you slowly get into depression thinking that you are worthless.<\/p>\n<p>Still, there are people in your life who always want you and see value in you every time.\u00a0They understand you are down but strong, they are always there for you. \u00a0Your value as a person like the note is still intact but it is our perception and comparison to the life of others that make us feel low and weak. Failures are temporary setbacks rather they are hidden big learning opportunities.<\/p>\n<h4>Be a man of action &#8211; create your own destiny &#8211; write your own rules &#8211; success principles &#8211;\u00a0Be the author of your life story<\/h4>\n<p>Every person is valuable and has special strengths that\u00a0it may have never focussed upon. You may not have stopped to break from a cycle of life that is continuous and deadly if you get into it. You need to bring all your focus into your ambitions and dreams to realise your true value. Be a child again. Live with this philosophy forever &#8211; I am fearless and a winner. You should have big dreams and ambition that drives you for the Life. \u00a0They can be any like starting a job, startup, social work, spending life with family. There is not a single straight line or defined path that we should all follow. We should follow our own hearts and create our own paths. Write your own destiny. Are you afraid of losing a\u00a0job or becoming unstable &#8211; any way you are loosing life and your health that should have been more important?<\/p>\n<p>Spend time with yourself, start feeling yourself, do hard work, be fearless &#8211; you will realise what you are capable of doing. Keep doing\/flowing because actions generate value otherwise nobody like still stinky water.<\/p>\n<p>Please share your life stories and experience in the comments section below or send us an\u00a0email.
