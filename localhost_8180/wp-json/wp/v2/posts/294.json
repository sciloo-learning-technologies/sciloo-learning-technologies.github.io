The Soyuz IT\u201311 took 3 people including Ship\u2019s Commander Y.V. Malyshev and Flight Engineer G.M. Strekalov to the Salyut-7 orbiting Space Station.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Moments in Space Station<\/strong><br \/>\nThe crew spent seven days inside the station during which they conducted scientific and technical studies including 43 experimental sessions. His work was mainly in the fields of biomedicine and remote sensing. He also studied the effectiveness of Yoga in weightlessness. He took photographs for northern part of India in a mission to find suitable sites for nuclear plant installations.<\/p>\n<p>Cosmonauts are trained the most to cope with the effects of zero gravity on the body and mind. Sharma, while giving a lecture in Bangalore on the kind of training that is given to astronauts, recalled that they were all made to sleep with their heads lower than their feet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Power of Yoga<\/strong><br \/>\nSharma says that six months before the launch, he dropped the fitness regime that the other cosmonauts were following and started intensive yoga. This was to assess whether yoga helps people cope better with the lack of gravity.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Rakesh Sharma - Indian Superhero - sciloo.com\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/oUYNYARKsBY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><strong>Our India is Best<\/strong><br \/>\nWhile he was in space, then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in a famous conversation asked him how does India look from space, Sharma replied \u201cSaare Jahan Se Achcha\u201d meaning \u2018the Best in the world\u2019.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Honours<\/strong><br \/>\nSeveral honours such as the honour of Hero of Soviet Union upon his return from the space, Ashoka Chakra by Indian Govt. were conferred on him.
