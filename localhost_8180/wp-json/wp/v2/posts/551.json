You need to make the car light weight. The tyre of the car should be freely moving. You can join two caps of bottle in opposite direction to give it stability.<br \/>\nMake two holes with the help of a screwdriver, one in the middle of the bottle and other is in the base of bottle perpendicular to 1st hole.<br \/>\nPut one thick pipe across the two holes. The pipe&#8217;s diameter should be big enough to push enough air to generate good amount of force to push the car. Check the bend in the pipe is not too much to block the air flow out.<br \/>\nOn the upper end of pipe tie one balloon with the help of rubber band.<br \/>\nBlow the balloon from another end of the pipe and put it down.<br \/>\nYou will see as the air come out from balloon it pushes the car in the forward direction which drives our car. Below is the representational picture of how the newton&#8217;s car should look.<\/p>\n<h4>Learnings<\/h4>\n<p>Kids learn the concept of energy and motion. They use their hands-eyes coordination to build a model with a discussion among themselves &#8211; increase their problem-solving skills. They are introduced to Newton, why he is famous, what he did.
