Kids should be provided with a comfortable and approachable environment where they should be free to use diverse methods for thinking and collaborating.<\/p>\n<h4>Traditional classroom<\/h4>\n<p>Traditionally classroom teaching or learning is more focussed on maintaining silence where kids are told not to speak and interact loudly to each other. This environment hampers their brain development in the long run. Kids are even scolded and given punishment for speaking differently than teachers. You would remember the scene (linked below) from PK movie that signifies that this even prevails in universities.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"What is a machine? - Funny scene | 3 Idiots | Aamir Khan | R Madhavan | Sharman Joshi\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/-MlkASchodc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Traditional classrooms or even today&#8217;s classrooms have teachers to<a href=\"http:\/\/data.worldbank.org\/indicator\/SE.PRM.ENRL.TC.ZS\"> students ratio ~1:30 or\u00a0more<\/a> and this means personalised learning is not inherently\u00a0possible as a teacher have too many students to reach and teach. This result in a coercive method (mostly one way from teacher to students) which is harmful to learning.<\/p>\n<h4>Authority versus\u00a0Authoritarian<\/h4>\n<p>Teachers become authoritarian (running their own rules, forceful way of teaching, punishment, etc.) instead of authority on the\u00a0subjects (expert in their fields). This\u00a0way of working\u00a0is\u00a0not\u00a0healthy for open thinking and\u00a0discussions. Kids are scared to even to speak\u00a0simple things\u00a0and\u00a0their\u00a0growth becomes stagnant.<\/p>\n<h4>New model &#8211; Progressive<\/h4>\n<p>There is a need for the new model called progressive, personalised, \u00a0or constructive teaching. These paradigms focus that kids make meaning and understand things by experiencing themselves. They make sense of their surroundings and world, the teacher can act as a catalyst to spark the excitement and curiosity. This spark is the most important impression that will be with them all their life and guide their thought process and\u00a0actions.<\/p>\n<p>Please share your thoughts in the comment section or by reaching to us.
