Basically, what they see as limitations in their usage and\nwhat things they desire when buying a new refrigerator will be good\nopportunities to increase the ease of use and satisfy users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1><a>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Results\nand Analysis<\/a><\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>To lead in the competition you need to hear and understand the\nvoice of customers, potential buyers, and all the stakeholders and adapting the\nproduct\/business strategies accordingly. The current problem belongs to the refrigerator\nmarket segment and the problem is how we can satisfy variety of users by\ndelivering better quality and feature rich refrigerator meeting their needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For solving this problem, we needed to collect, process the\ndata of how different types of users use a refrigerator and what features they\nsee in a refrigerator that they will surely buy if one such refrigerator comes\nto the market. We will discuss below how we came to the same frame and thinking\nlevel in which the users were thinking and what recommendations we proposed to\nachieve the desired problem objective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will walk you through the process that we followed from\nconnecting with the users, getting their needs to build the solutions.

We have discussed this part in the start of Section 2.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nPlanning the journey ahead<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We planned what exactly we need to\ndo next and what different steps we have to follow to reach till the solutions.\nWe discussed in the team that we need to interact with the users in best\npossible ways. To achieve this objective we defined our goals and scope under\nwhich we will be interacting with the end users and the stake holders. We\nplanned to do the team work till the data consolidations and after that\nsolutions\/prototypes will be done individually.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This planning resulted in steps\nfrom 2.3 to 2.10 below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nGoal settings for user observations <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We defined the goals and scope of our\ntasks which will guide and keep us on track in the data collection process and\nuser observations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are the goals we\nbrainstormed and scoped as our boundary:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;\nUsage type of Refrigerator<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For\nexample: making ice, water cooling, protecting perishable food items, storing\nmilk, meat, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;\nFunctionality improvements <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For\nexample: faster cooling, uniform temperature at around all the corners, odor detection\nand control, capacity indicator, rotten item indicator, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;\nDesign improvements<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For\nexample: exteriors and interiors, mobility, accessing door, modular design,\nnoiseless operation etc. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2.3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;\nReduced energy consumption <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h3>2.3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;\nUnderstanding types of users (Age, Sex, Culture,\nand location wise, etc.)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h2>2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nStrategy for observation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We used the following user observation methods explained\nwith the reasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;\nUser Interviews <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be done in\nperson or over the phone. It is one of the best techniques because you directly\ninteract with a user and can interject questions in a dynamic environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;\nParticipatory observation with context<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand things\nfrom the point of view of users and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; making\nthem feel comfortable that we are there to help them and solve their problems.\nYou can see them using or working with the refrigerators and observe their\nparticular way of doing some things and can interject your questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2.4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;\nSurveys <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Facebook polls for\ngetting problems from variety of the users. We received ~10 survey results by\nusing this method. (Refer Point 4 in Section 2 of Design Study Summary).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2.4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;\nVideo<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You get the feel of behavior\/dynamic\nflow of refrigerator and usage workflow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2.4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;\nPhotos<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can point to a\nparticular problem or improvement area. Photos are also useful to give the feel\nof environment and layout.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2.4.6&nbsp;&nbsp;\nFocus group<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To collect the pre\nobservation data with some interacting group.

By getting this information, you can\nbetter observe the user and can find inefficiencies (opportunity areas) in the\nworkflow or usage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We received lots of data regarding the modularity when we\nwere seeing the participants performing their tasks and not using particular\nareas for a long time, we interjected on the spot questions that why it is happening,\nthat gave us more insight for data collection at lower level details.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had to struggle a bit for getting surveys because people\nwere avoiding them. But after we convinced them that it is totally anonymous\nand no personal information will be recorded, we got few key inputs from survey\nparticipants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nAssumptions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sample Size: <\/strong>Our\nSample size is around 20-25, we have included people ranging from villages to\ncities, from young to old generation, both genders, novice (villager) and\nexperts (mechanic), persons from different profession. Though the sample set is\nsmall but it is diverse and we got similar kind of responses from similar user\nprofiles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;If this assumption of\ndiversity and reasonable sample size is not met then the data outcome can be\nbiased in one or two areas, which can affect the recommendations we will give\nand it can be deviated from the voice of most of the customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anonymous Surveys:<\/strong>\nWe conducted survey anonymously, just asked them what kind of user they are. We\ndidn\u2019t need any personal data to seek what is the voice of our customers. These\nkinds of surveys work when people want to participate and contribute ideas but\ndon\u2019t want to come outside in front seat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;If this assumption is\nnot met, then user may feel tracked with their personal information and\npsychologically they may not feel comfortable and may not give their full\ncapacity data due to the mentioned reasons. If this happen, we can only get\nvery few samples and those can\u2019t be treated valuable as the participation is\nnot free to think and act.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Refrigerator\nEnvironment:<\/strong> We have limited our scope with only the interaction and usage\nwith the refrigerator. We have done very less research on the environment and\nworkflow around the refrigerator. We have analyzed that these kind of special\nconditions and environment use cases are few ones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if this assumption is not met, we may observe some voids\nin the data related to environment and workflows. Though we have captured some\nenvironments like Canteen Kitchen, Home kitchens, but the study was not\nextensive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nDebriefing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During debrief we assembled at a place of choice and time\nthat we already agreed upon in planning. This session started with every one\nwriting their key findings on the different color notes and posting it on the\nwhite board. It was a very interactive session, where each person was talking\nabout some of the interesting things he found during the observation, while\nposting the notes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with our key findings in terms of user needs, we also\ncaptured some environment of refrigerator usage so that we can brainstorm on\ndesign part during brainstorming session. Some user environments were placed on\nthe board; refer to the column 1 of notes in Figure 1 for more details. Figure\n2 and 3 are also part of debriefing sessions; you can refer them for more\ninsights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nRecommendations<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After the debrief session, on the same day, we collated the\ndata and prioritized it to focus on the important findings of the user\nresearch. After all the arguments and counter arguments by each team member, we\njolted down the key recommendations. But before we discuss the recommendations,\nI would like to walk you through what user were saying about the findings during\ninterviews, surveys. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please refer to Figure 12 for the visual representation of\nuser responses for each category.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/image-8.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1139\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Figure 8 \u2013 User responses per category<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the Figure 12, it is evident that most users want to\nsee:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>More functionality in their refrigerator, modular\ndesign, they want everything fast and automated about their refrigerator.<\/li><li>Some kind of visual or sound indication of\nrefrigerator functioning and running status. <\/li><li>Exterior is also on users\u2019 priority list because\nthey want to see and control everything about the refrigerator without the door\nevery time. <\/li><li>Users were also having problems with mobility to\neasily move and clean the refrigerator.<\/li><li>Users also wanted some solutions to cope with\nodor (rotten food items, taste).<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nMockups and Prototyping<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We got the top recommendations as discussed in section 3.5.\nI am going to explain in depth the solutions brainstormed and generated with\nmockups and drawings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Modular Design<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>For making refrigerator more modular and\nadaptable is to make adjustable horizontal and vertical dividers so you can get\nthe flexible space for variety of containers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with this, provision of modular\nfreezer and vegetables sections can be provided. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Freezer can be pulled out from the top and\ncan be placed at the bottom and veg section can be placed on the top based on\nthe season (winter or summer) or as per the usage patterns. There can be a\nprovision of some button in\/control outside the freezer section to convert it into\nveg section and vice versa. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Provision of dividing the main door into\nnumbers of smaller doors can be provided, so to reach to a particular section\nof the refrigerator, you need not to open the complete big door. Figure 9\nexplains the points visually.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/image-9.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1140\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Figure 9 &#8211; Mock up for Modular Design<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Transparent Doors<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By providing the transparent doors and side\nwalls for the home use can greatly increase the ease of use and satisfaction of\nthe buyers because they need not to open the refrigerator every time just to\ncheck if something is placed inside; they can check the things from outside to\nbetter plan. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This concept is being used in super markets\nbut not penetrated homes yet. Although solution may not sound aesthetic as it\nexposes all your things placed in the refrigerator to the outsiders in your\nhome. The solution for that can be providing some control outside to change the\ntransparency of door back to opaque and vice versa. Check the Figure below to\nget the feel how it will look if implemented.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/image-11.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1142\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Figure 10 &#8211; Mock up for Transparent Doors and sides<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Digital display, mobility, help and labels<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Figure 11 explains all these needs. Wheels\nare provided for better mobility. Wheels can be provided with the locks to fix\nthe wheels in one place and stopping them from unintentional motion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For better controlling refrigerator and\nknowing its status, some kind of digital LCD\/LED display can be provided\noutside the door. That will make the tasks easy of controlling temperature\n(with options of <sup>o<\/sup>C or <sup>o<\/sup>F), humidity from outside without\nopening the refrigerator. Along with the controls, this display will also show\nthe information about refrigerator like its capacity (e.g. 200 Ltr), current\ntemperature inside refrigerator, odor level or other kind of visual warnings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternate approach for the \u201coutside display\u201d\ncan be a remote control with inbuilt display. This remote can control the refrigerator\nsettings and shows its different properties like current temperature, humidity,\nodor level, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>User help can also be displayed on the\ndisplay for easy accessibility. If a hard copy of the help is to be provided, a\nhelp slot can be provided to keep the help book or some other related document\nat a handy place. Help can include the topics for example best practices of how\nto use a refrigerator efficiently, what kind of things can be put inside the refrigerator\nand at what temperature, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/image-12.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1143\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Figure 11 &#8211; Mock up for Display, settings outside, help slot, wheels for mobility<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Output ports and light body<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOutput ports\u201d is an innovative feature as\nshown in Figure 12 below.

Exterior\nchanges\\improvements <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Transparent doors and walls\ncheck the diagram.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can be easily provided but we\nneed to see the aesthetic effects after that. If we can also provide some\nway\/button &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to switch between\ntransparent and opaque walls, then it can be a great ease of use and\ninteraction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, we can have camera\ninstalled internally that can display the inside story outside on display.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Interior\nchanges\\improvements <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Modular design, check the\ndiagram.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Inputs\/outputs<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Refrigerator can be provided\nwith ports (like an usb ports) where you can connect compatible pipes to cool\ncontainer outside the  refrigerator. This\ncan extend the refrigerator capacity. But there can be some limitation like to\nprevent leaking pipes or containers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some mechanism should be present\nthere to detect these kinds of leaks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is looking promising but we\nneed to observe the ROI on its research by conducting more exhaustive surveys\nand VOCs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Efficient power\nconsumption<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. We can improve in energy use\nby leveraging the current research of inverter technology <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. If refrigerator is empty then\nit should be auto switched off or reduce the energy consumption if the cooling\nis needed only &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in specific part or\ncompartment inside the refrigerator. Can be done easily by using sensors firing\nafter a certain interval &nbsp;&nbsp; frequency to\ncheck the refrigerator is empty or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. For the display or light\ninside we can use,&nbsp; high efficient LEDs,\nLEDs consume power of 1\/10 of the bulb used inside the &nbsp;&nbsp; refrigerator and provide better light output with less heat\ndissipation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Electric fluctuation can be\navoided by built in stabilizers, many makers have model that have this feature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. Indicators<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Can be easily implemented,\nrefer the diagram.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8. Door<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Door should be slowed down when it is pushed hard\neither by mistake or by a child, so not to imbalance the things, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; liquids placed inside it. It can\nbe easily done using the latest motion suppression and vibration reduction\ntechnologies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>9. Mobility<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mobility can easily be done with balancing and sturdy\nwheels that can handle some vibration due to the compressor and motor &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; running. Locks can be provided to wheels to\nlock their motion once the refrigerator is installed in the environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Customers prefer the brand mobility solution as they\nbelieve them to be of equal quality as the refrigerator is. They don&#8217;t want to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go to the local vendor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>10. Odor handling<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Odor can be handled by placing a sensor detecting some\ngases that are released from the rotten things. Beep warning  can be provided to the user along with flashing\nvisual signal on outer refrigerator display. Electronic nose that detects like &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nose gases like sulphide, ammonia, carbon\nmonoxide, etc. can be used to detect odor and integrated with microcontroller\nlogic &nbsp; to send signals for warning (visually\nand sound).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Food taste can be improved with the air flow\nregulation\/restriction inside the refrigerator. Suggesting the customer best\npractices &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to avoid this situation\nis a good viable option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Best Practices:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Always put a lid on your containers with food<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. If some vegetable\/fruit\/meat is cut, please wrap\nin a thin plastic or put in a special container inside the refrigerator for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that purpose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. We can control the temperature inside the refrigerator\ndoesn&#8217;t rises too fast or too slow so that &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you\ncan get your expected temperature setting whenever you want food. This can easily\nbe achieved by improving the design &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of\nthe compressor to achieve high cooling velocity. Speed up the cooling gas\nliquidation and vaporization using the latest.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Subject 1.&nbsp; Problem\/Purpose Increase satisfaction and ease of use when interacting with a refrigerator.
