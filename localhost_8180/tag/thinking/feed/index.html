<p><g class="gr_ gr_19 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="19" data-gr-id="19">Inspiration</g> for this article &#8211;  <strong>Roberta B. Ness (worked on Ovarian Cancer)</strong></p>



<p>Even though in today’s world we are more eager to invent and do more but innovation in healthcare and many other sectors like water treatment, garbage cleaning etc. is very slow for example there is no cheap cancer treatment, <g class="gr_ gr_105 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="105" data-gr-id="105">cost-effectiveness</g> of other medical treatments, etc.<br></p>



<p>Frames define our thinking, the kind of expectations in a particular situation. Frames are cognitive and emotions expectations and can also result in reactions. For example &#8211; you are expecting a hello from a person meeting you the first time, instead, he tells you who are you?</p>



<p>This breaks the flow or assumptions in your thinking.</p>



<p><strong>Frame</strong></p>



<p style="text-align:left">To innovate &#8211; we must break frames. Scientists used to assume that bacteria can’t grow in acidic environment of the stomach, break this assumptions and check the data to explain anomalies.</p>



<p><strong>Observation</strong></p>



<p>To be an innovator &#8211; you must be a great observer.</p>



<p><strong>Flipping the view</strong></p>



<p>God creates every creature to perfection, Darwin flipped it and said it is not <g class="gr_ gr_29 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling" id="29" data-gr-id="29">perfection</g> and <g class="gr_ gr_40 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="40" data-gr-id="40">lets</g> find the reason for it. </p>



<p>Darwin imagined himself as plant to understand the evolution.</p>



<p><strong>Analogy</strong></p>



<p>What is the cause, cells that are around ovarian are same as in breathing pipe (airway<g class="gr_ gr_10 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation multiReplace" id="10" data-gr-id="10">).</g> Is there can be <g class="gr_ gr_31 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="31" data-gr-id="31">reason</g> that smoking can also affect ovary like our airways.</p>



<p><strong>Élie Metchnikoff </strong>&#8211; the discovery of white blood cell (tried suicide 2 times, believed in Darwin theory). He did put a thorn in a fish and found white blood cells around it to protect from the attack. Read about this great scientist to know of his thinking approach.<br></p>



<p><strong>Be bold not cautious. </strong></p>



<p>World need innovation rather than invention for the sake of patent filing. We need to improve the world and solve problems rather than settle in life.<br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of us know that Edison holds around 1084 patent but do you know he doesn&#8217;t have the highest number of patents. The highest number of patents at the time of this writings are 5183, almost 5 times than Edison&#8217;s. In this article, I will summarize my learnings from one of such inventors &#8211; Mark Johnson [2] (holds more than 500 patents, but not on the list).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-953 size-full" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/patents.jpg" alt="" width="689" height="457" /></p>
<p>From here on, the article will present as if Mark Johnson is talking to you directly.</p>
<h3>Start</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t learn to be an inventor, I was interested in s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">olving problem, got the first assignment with the deadline of 3 months. I worked for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 months on vibration reduction from the magnetic tape in tape recorder and player. After that, I worked on f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">errite core transformer (having small size but high frequencies) for ~4 years.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nobel prize years</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was working on the similar technologies ( Giant magnetoresistance [3] ) for which- Nobel prize was awarded, this invention had applications in the video recorder, hard disk, etc. and ultimately used to shrink the size of these devices and many more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was important because it is highly sensitive (low magnetic force high resistance change) and gives easy detection.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moores law &#8211; increase in no of inventions per year by Mark</span></h3>
<p>I initially worked on materials and then my organization thought I should focus on display now as we were focussing on TV display or general purpose display in Philips. When we started working on display we got the following.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lcd &#8211; 20 patent</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oled &#8211; 40 patent</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">e-ink &#8211; 100 patents</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Still, we were not leaders in display technologies.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were working on the Flat panel, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low power reflective display and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inventors were leading the planning and executions of these project rather than project management guys. My c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">olleague invented 3 out of 10 display technologies in the market but those were not where we could earn the money for the business. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in AMOLED technology, we were the 2nd company to work out the technology and build the first working model.</span></p>
<p>During these years, I noticed that I was filing patents double than the previous year just like CPU power is doubled every year.</p>
<h3>Paper-like display</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were the first on paper like display &#8211; building the prototype and developing a working technology. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon was taking e-ink display from a company which was using license of this Philips technology (there were 100s of patents) from Philips.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big challenge </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then we needed to come up with next big challenges and after utilizing the experience and literature we came to following topics where work could be done.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neuroscience </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emotions</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reconnaissance</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We needed to work on high-risk high reward ideas but the first step was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hypothesis testing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; fail hypothesis fastest. We picked later different ideas ranging from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food, hair to teeth whitening which was very successful.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Process of inventions</span></h3>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">First scope</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, the idea to implement or patent</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Problems &#8211; how to solve them</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior art &#8211; value of the tech, competitors</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">determine the approach </span>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    No art &#8211; direct patent</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    Some &#8211; workaround</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    Much art  avoid or circumvention (use TRIZ technique)</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find a specific problem that valuable control points</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about 5 to 10 years in future</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evaluate on feasibility, novelty, desirability</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The format of a patent</span></h3>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspiration</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short description</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illustration of invention</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Main tech feature</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Main prior art</span></li>
</ol>
<h3>Advice</h3>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work out of your comfort zone</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">No need to be expert, just do your work</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Material patents are most valuable</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spread out across teams and projects to best spread the process (instead of passive communication or emails)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inexperienced team can be productive with the well laid out process</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be the first to spot and get problems &#8211; snatch opportunities</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listening to the experience of 20-30 years is better than one or two sessions on current technology.</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everybody talks about space-time, string theory, parallel universe these days. When they talk about these topics, the concept of higher dimensions automatically pops out. Some people point out that time is the 4th dimension in space-time model (theory of General Gravity by Einstein). Others mention that there are more than <a href="http://press.cern/backgrounders/extra-dimensions">10 dimensions</a> (very small to be noticed) in string theory, see image below for illustration purpose. <img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-428" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stringspace-e1417811256405-300x288.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="288" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Our brain limitations</strong></em></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s dig deeper into the concepts. We are born and live in 3D world. Our brain and eyes are wired to see only till 3 dimensions &#8211; length, width, and height, we can&#8217;t imagine the world beyond. And that, according to many researchers, is the reason we can&#8217;t see the fourth dimension, or any other dimension beyond that. Physicists work under the assumption that there are at least 10 dimensions, but the majority of us will never &#8220;see&#8221; them. Because we only know life in 3-D, our brains don&#8217;t understand how to look for anything more. It is similar to a 2D living being which can&#8217;t comprehend the 3D world.</p>
<p><em><strong>2d world and 3d world &#8211; perception and change</strong></em></p>
<p>Edwin A. Abbot published a satirical novel called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland"><i><b>Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions.</b></i></a> He describes 2-dimensional objects life &#8211; a square with circles, triangles and rectangles. All the square sees only lines and to make sense of the shape they have to encircle the other objects, still difficult. When a 3d sphere enters his locked room in the 2-D world, he just can&#8217;t comprehend how something can suddenly appear from nowhere. At the same time, it is changing shapes as it is crossing the 2d plane. Then sphere takes the square to the 3d world after some time and square realise the source of confusion, he was limited by his wired brain and 2d world.</p>
<p><em><strong>Curiosity  &#8211; thinking complex</strong></em></p>
<p>Now the square is very happy to see all the objects from the top, seeing their shapes easily including height. He asks the sphere, can you take me to more higher dimensions, I want to see more for which sphere doesn&#8217;t have any answer. The sphere is confused and lost. He also needs somebody from the higher dimension to show us how our world looks from the 4th dimension, without which we are hold up by our brain limitations. Similar is the case with us, the humans.</p>
<p class="aLF-aPX-K0-aPE aLF-aPX-aLK-ayr-auR"><strong>4th dimension</strong></p>
<p class="aLF-aPX-K0-aPE aLF-aPX-aLK-ayr-auR">Every dimension is perpendicular to the previous dimensions, like 3rd dimension of the 3d world is perpendicular to the plane, for us it is very difficult to imagine the 90-degree angle to the 3d, again due to our limits :(. We are referring to the 4th or higher dimensions as spatial not time (space-time will be covered in a separate video).</p>
