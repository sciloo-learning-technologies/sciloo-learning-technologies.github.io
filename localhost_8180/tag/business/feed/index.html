<p>When you come to this article, it shows that you really want to understand what goes inside a business and how you can make it successful.</p>



<p>Business is not just about generating cash, earning, revenues, etc. Business is more about Customer first because any business <g class="gr_ gr_21 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="21" data-gr-id="21">generate</g> cash from customers. If customers <g class="gr_ gr_20 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="20" data-gr-id="20">doesn&#8217;t</g> trust your idea/products then your business days are in number. You should keep this trust alive for the whole life of your product. <g class="gr_ gr_185 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="185" data-gr-id="185">Customer</g> should understand what is buying and what is its reliability.</p>



<p>Approaches to a business</p>



<ol><li>Selling&nbsp;</li><li>Customer first</li></ol>



<p>When it is about just selling, you will ignore ethics, customer pain points and ultimately you will sell the products to many people. Nearly all of these customers today or tomorrow will realize the game played with them and then they will give factual details of what happened to others and then it spread like a fire. All your hard work and&nbsp;credibility can be at risk. When credibility is lost, it is really difficult to bring back because it is lost by behaviour which is difficult to correct. Recovery can be a painful and can be a&nbsp; lengthy process.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/05/27/00/58/trust-1418901__340.jpg" alt="" width="232" height="174"/></figure>



<p>When you keep customer first, then you are building trust with customer. You get a return of value (cash or trade) for your products. If customer feels this trust is broken it should be resolved to the customer satisfaction.&nbsp;As a business, you should not exist if you don&#8217;t exchange value. If you don&#8217;t return the value to the customer (product + mental satisfaction or trust) then it is better to not to do a business.</p>



<p>We follow the&nbsp;customer first approach at <g class="gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="4" data-gr-id="4">Sciloo</g> Learning Technologies. It looks simple in words but difficult to follow. You should be ready to incur financial loss in the few cases the and understand that is part of the learning and founding stone of a successful business.</p>



<p>In coming days, more articles will follow on different business aspects. We will target to solve a business&#8217;s problem and then explain the article rather than isolated concepts like marketing or selling etc.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We will see what kind of problems/misconceptions you can face in a tech startup. People get often confused between industry and market. There is a laser industry.However, there is no laser market. There is a welding market, a cutting market etc where lasers are used.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s discuss other important factors such as Market, Consumers and Offerings.</p>
<h5>Market</h5>
<p>As per economics, a market is a place where the price keeps supply and demand in check and balance. A market is a place where a certain amount of uses, functions, even desires exist which can be satisfied by the offerings. For example, the desire for clean hair is related to the hygienic but the desire to look beautiful which probably requires shampoo is not straightforward and easy to relate A shampoo which only accomplishes the first idea (to clean hair) doesn&#8217;t have a great value and is not expensive and can be prepared by a simple chemical formulation. A shampoo that can make you beautiful is not simple to make and can create a monopoly over the market.</p>
<h5>Users</h5>
<p>Who can afford the desire to look beautiful? Here comes the question of the use, the desire, and the user segmentation. We start from our invention, industry and then we transform it into use and desire. We then try to see the segmentation of the user group and have to think who can replace you (your product&#8217;s substitutions) or give you a competition.</p>
<p>A substitute may not do the same as your product but it can replace it. Let&#8217;s understand with an example, the first substitute to a shampoo is not a shampoo but the action of not doing anything &#8211; don&#8217;t wash my hair. `</p>
<p>Value is felt by the user so look at the value from the user point of view and don&#8217;t assume it yourself that the user will find the top value in your offerings.</p>
<p>If you are a startup company with an unparallel invention, such as a software, understanding the value is not a problem, it is your existence in coming years which the clients worry about that you will be gone out of business and their work will be held in the middle. Clients will prefer a low profile tech company which is less efficient but more long lasting. Look at the possible risks for your users and try to convince them.</p>
<h5>Offerings</h5>
<p>Products and offerings can be offered in either of the following dimensions.</p>
<h6>1. Position for innovation</h6>
<h6>2. Position for imitation</h6>
<h6>3. Position for adaptation</h6>
<h6>4. Reposition yourself again</h6>
<p>You need not follow a single direction out of the above list but it can change with time. Position your business with the utmost car, make it either low-end or high-end, don&#8217;t get confused with multiple directions. Get an advantage in one of the following dimensions but the pioneering spirit is a must to become the market leader and big success otherwise you will have to satisfy yourself being a follower.</p>
<h6>Technical edge</h6>
<p>Technological edge is not just a patent, it is also having experience and execution expertise. Without technical advantage, it is very difficult to become a pioneer in the market or industry.</p>
<h6>Scarce asset</h6>
<p>Physical assets, for example, if I have ~80% of the world&#8217;s phosphate sites, I am the leader in phosphate whatever happens.</p>
<h6>User behaviour &#8211; love for the brand</h6>
<p>Bring a differentiation to the users, it can be geographical or it can be in perception. You have to convince the users through perception may be in performance, look and feel, or savings etc.</p>
<p>And finally, to look credible, you need three rules given below.</p>
<p>Be comprehensible, it must be clear and significant for the buyer &#8211; either fewer risks or more value, or the right time.</p>
<p>It must have the possibility to gain value from the company on its value market, so check how the user value your product and company.</p>
<p>Safe from competition &#8211; it must defend against competition so that it brings something difficult to imitate and can create monopoly just like google and tesla.</p>
