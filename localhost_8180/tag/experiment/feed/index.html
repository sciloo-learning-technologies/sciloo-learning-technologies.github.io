										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wind is moving air and caused by differences in air pressure within our atmosphere or we can say it is the flow of gases on a large scale. Wind is caused by uneven heating of the atmosphere by the sun, variations in the earth’s surface, and rotation of the earth. Mountains, bodies of water, and vegetation all influence wind flow patterns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wind is also used to generate electricity. For the generation of electricity from wind, we use wind turbines. A wind turbine works the opposite of a fan. Instead of using electricity to make wind, like a fan, wind turbines use wind to make electricity. The wind turns the blades which connect to a generator and makes electricity.</span></p>
<p><b>Experiment in Lab:-</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We performed this experiment in our Lab. For wind energy generator experiment we need one dc motor, one LED, one turbine which we rotate with fan or wind.</span></p>
<p><b>Procedure:-</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make a turbine with either a plastic bottle or with cardboard.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Untitled.png" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is Untitled.png" width="164" height="175" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stick the turbine to a stand. Fix the stand on dc motor with both of motor input current points are connected to the LED.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Untitled1.png" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is Untitled1.png" width="187" height="167" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, place the turbine in front of the electric fan. As the motor blade rotates, it rotates the shaft of the motor which generates electricity and the LED glows. We will post the video of the experiment soon.</span></p>
<p>Basically, we are converting one form on energy to another (wind to electricity). The magnet inside the motor rotates which induces the current in the motor winding using induction and this induced current give electricity to the connected led.</p>

<p>The interesting point is if the ball is light and you push it away or sideways it doesn&#8217;t fall but wobbles in a complex path. This is difficult to believe. Kids will love it and you will be busy finding the answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We will be posting videos with different round objects later after experimenting with them. We will also try to build one airplane to see how it behaves.</p>
<p>Please comment the reason of this behaviour.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This model works on the principle of newton’s 3rd law &#8211; EVERY ACTION HAS AN EQUAL AND OPPOSITE REACTION.</p>
<p>As we know for driving anything we need energy. For driving a car, we need fuel (petrol/diesel) or electricity if it is an electric car. But, in this case, our newton’s car extract energy from the balloon&#8217;s air pressure.</p>
<p>Balloon pushes the air out and air pushes the balloon away, which in turn pushes the car and make it travel the distance.</p>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<p>Take an emp<img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-554 size-full" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Newton_car.jpg" alt="Newton_car" width="320" height="180" />ty plastic bottle. You need to make the car light weight. The tyre of the car should be freely moving. You can join two caps of bottle in opposite direction to give it stability.<br />
Make two holes with the help of a screwdriver, one in the middle of the bottle and other is in the base of bottle perpendicular to 1st hole.<br />
Put one thick pipe across the two holes. The pipe&#8217;s diameter should be big enough to push enough air to generate good amount of force to push the car. Check the bend in the pipe is not too much to block the air flow out.<br />
On the upper end of pipe tie one balloon with the help of rubber band.<br />
Blow the balloon from another end of the pipe and put it down.<br />
You will see as the air come out from balloon it pushes the car in the forward direction which drives our car. Below is the representational picture of how the newton&#8217;s car should look.</p>
<h4>Learnings</h4>
<p>Kids learn the concept of energy and motion. They use their hands-eyes coordination to build a model with a discussion among themselves &#8211; increase their problem-solving skills. They are introduced to Newton, why he is famous, what he did. Kids are told to apply the same principle in different areas like boat, rocket, etc.</p>
