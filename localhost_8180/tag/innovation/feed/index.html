<p><g class="gr_ gr_19 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="19" data-gr-id="19">Inspiration</g> for this article &#8211;  <strong>Roberta B. Ness (worked on Ovarian Cancer)</strong></p>



<p>Even though in today’s world we are more eager to invent and do more but innovation in healthcare and many other sectors like water treatment, garbage cleaning etc. is very slow for example there is no cheap cancer treatment, <g class="gr_ gr_105 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="105" data-gr-id="105">cost-effectiveness</g> of other medical treatments, etc.<br></p>



<p>Frames define our thinking, the kind of expectations in a particular situation. Frames are cognitive and emotions expectations and can also result in reactions. For example &#8211; you are expecting a hello from a person meeting you the first time, instead, he tells you who are you?</p>



<p>This breaks the flow or assumptions in your thinking.</p>



<p><strong>Frame</strong></p>



<p style="text-align:left">To innovate &#8211; we must break frames. Scientists used to assume that bacteria can’t grow in acidic environment of the stomach, break this assumptions and check the data to explain anomalies.</p>



<p><strong>Observation</strong></p>



<p>To be an innovator &#8211; you must be a great observer.</p>



<p><strong>Flipping the view</strong></p>



<p>God creates every creature to perfection, Darwin flipped it and said it is not <g class="gr_ gr_29 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling" id="29" data-gr-id="29">perfection</g> and <g class="gr_ gr_40 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="40" data-gr-id="40">lets</g> find the reason for it. </p>



<p>Darwin imagined himself as plant to understand the evolution.</p>



<p><strong>Analogy</strong></p>



<p>What is the cause, cells that are around ovarian are same as in breathing pipe (airway<g class="gr_ gr_10 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation multiReplace" id="10" data-gr-id="10">).</g> Is there can be <g class="gr_ gr_31 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="31" data-gr-id="31">reason</g> that smoking can also affect ovary like our airways.</p>



<p><strong>Élie Metchnikoff </strong>&#8211; the discovery of white blood cell (tried suicide 2 times, believed in Darwin theory). He did put a thorn in a fish and found white blood cells around it to protect from the attack. Read about this great scientist to know of his thinking approach.<br></p>



<p><strong>Be bold not cautious. </strong></p>



<p>World need innovation rather than invention for the sake of patent filing. We need to improve the world and solve problems rather than settle in life.<br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We need to focus on the following two dimensions to ensure that our innovation has a future.</p>
<ol>
<li>Isolated or Systematic innovation</li>
<li>Creation or Substitution innovation</li>
</ol>
<h4>Isolated or Systematic innovation</h4>
<p>Innovation that works alone such as simple hand tools like Moka pot or pen. For the pen to make work you need a sheet of paper and that&#8217;s it. If the product is bit complex and is a part of production system such as design, development, verification in a process and reviewed regularly to maintain the quality, it is called systematic innovation. An example can be motor where different parts are acquired from different producers and assembled with the quality checks and other processes.</p>
<h4>Creation or Substitution innovation</h4>
<p>Your innovation can create a new market which is a difficult and rare phenomenon. Take an example of Google, which created a new market &#8211; search engine advertising and data analytics on the mass scale real behavioral data. What is the challenge, nobody knows it and we don&#8217;t know if there is a such market that exists or not. It is based on a latent need that we feel to be real but we are not sure.</p>
<p>On the opposite side, there is the substitution innovation representing the majority of the innovations. We compare the innovation features to the existing ones to judge which one is better. So it is kind of a reference system and the product/service will be placed for comparison. There are also obstacles to substitution &#8211; we need to check the consumers of our product whether they easily accept innovation or oppose it.</p>
<h4>Value created by my innovation</h4>
<p>It is the value perceived by the consumer. So, what is the value perceived by the consumer? It can be a trade-off &#8211; a compromise between the benefits that the consumer will perceive and the sacrifices linked to the innovation.</p>
<p>In some cases, it can be easy where customer understand the value because he can see the effects immediately but in some other cases, the perceived value will be way below reality. It is often the case for technological innovators &#8211; we speak of performance level, of technical challenges, whereas what interests the customer are the immediate benefits &#8211; the answer to his needs.</p>
<h4>Benefits for the customers</h4>
<ol>
<li>Money &#8211; You can save money with the innovation.</li>
<li>Time &#8211; I will save you time as mostly seen in software products.</li>
<li>Pain &#8211; It solves a problem that was not solved till now or was very difficult to do.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the three main benefits, the more we manage to combine, the better will be the value. The better will be the perceived value of our innovations. Show the facts and talk numbers rather talking in  the abstract terms about these 3 benefits and customers will appreciate the whole idea.</p>
<h4>Sacrifices for the customers</h4>
<ol>
<li>Transfer Costs</li>
<li>Risks</li>
<li>Unsustainability &#8211; such as a new startup can go out of business and responsibility anytime as they have not stayed in the market for a long time.</li>
</ol>
<p>We often overestimate the benefits and underestimate the sacrifices linked to the innovation.</p>
<h4>Be careful with self-centered analysis and try to have the views and opinions of the following actors</h4>
<ol>
<li>Consumers</li>
<li>Future Consumers</li>
</ol>
<p>The value perceived by the consumer in not uniform in all the markets. It is our responsibility to improve this value gradually by improving our product/service features and offerings. Start with the main targets first mainly verticals and then open the market progressively to other targets.</p>
<p>This value is not felt just by the end user (consumer) but often there is a range of consumers. If we use a supplier, the supplier will also need to find a value for himself, and it goes to the last consumer. Sometimes, the user finds a high value but the buyer doesn&#8217;t &#8211; solve it by creating value for each step of this consumer chain, for each stakeholder.</p>
<p>It can be different according to the different stakeholders but it must always exist and be taken care. Startups need to be aware of these dimensions early on.</p>
<p>Please share if you have any interesting story or experience for value creation and problem faced.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Managing an innovative projects focus on</p>
<ol>
<li>Reducing uncertainty by planning</li>
<li>Creating hypotheses</li>
<li>Get into action mode quickly to confirm or reject hypotheses</li>
<li>Convert hypotheses into knowledge &#8211; Discovery</li>
<li>Path to the discovery</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step is the coming up with hypotheses on</p>
<ol>
<li>Business model</li>
<li>Technology</li>
<li>Competition</li>
<li>Partners</li>
</ol>
<p>Each hypothesis will be tracked on following topics</p>
<ol>
<li>Its basis</li>
<li>Its effort estimation</li>
<li>Its owner</li>
<li>Its progress</li>
</ol>
<p>Critical hypotheses will also be identified that can affect several elements, has an important effect on performances, the feasibility of the project, important investments.</p>
<h4>Planning</h4>
<p>Milestones will also be planned where the main hypotheses will be discussed. For each milestone, there will be a target fixed &#8211; the hypotheses and the costs etc. Each milestone is used to validate at least one hypothesis, each hypothesis must be validated at least with one milestone, e.g. a critical milestone is used to validate a critical hypothesis.</p>
<h4>Acceptance</h4>
<p>From a hypothesis, design an experiment to</p>
<ol>
<li>Measure the gaps</li>
<li>learn and rephrase the hypothesis</li>
<li>Move to the next one</li>
</ol>
<p>Eric Ries recommends multiple of these learning loops and the reduction of their cost. These experiments require a minimum viable product that can be demonstrated. It isn&#8217;t a prototype, it is much simpler. The idea is to experiment the functionalities as soon as possible.</p>
<p>With early adopters accepting faults and actively participating to improve the product, you mustn&#8217;t specify it precisely, but let the missing features be underlined by negative feedbacks.</p>
<p>So you must organise these experiments early on and experiment often reduces the cost, set back the commitment of important and irreversible costs and multiply the methods to acquire knowledge. In other words, managing an innovative project is going the traditional way of project management but taking the uncertainties into account.</p>
<h4>Approach</h4>
<p>The structured and systematic approach should be followed. It is even more necessary in the case of an innovative project as cognitive bias have been identified by psychologists working on creators of innovative businesses and innovative project managers.</p>
<p>We often keep in mind information reinforcing the chosen hypotheses, reject information challenging these hypotheses. We tend to forget the hypothetical nature and the fragile baselines, overestimate success and undervalue risks.</p>
<p>We become optimistic and it is a good point. The role of managing tools of innovative projects is to go along with this optimism but through the structured and thorough tools leaving any bias</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>In the closing remarks, managing an innovative project means to work on three areas</p>
<ol>
<li>Grow knowledge and reduce uncertainties using multiple experiments</li>
<li>Build cohesion within the team</li>
<li>Bring common direction as the team may change as the project grows</li>
</ol>
<p>Please share your experience or ideas how we can manage these kinds of projects.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We need to elaborate the problems we are solving more clearly so that their solutions becomes transparent. We should not only be focusing on the technical part but also on validating the ideas and its reach. Henry Ford mass produced internal combustion engine and cars which were available only for few rich people earlier, he created a new market with significant social impacts.</p>
<p>You should identify the main stakeholders for your innovative idea or product. You must analyse and evaluate the resources, the process of these companies, as innovation often appears on the border of markets dominated by important actors. You could be partners or disruptions as the case may be. At this point, I demonstrated why I think that theories and practices you can do are not only topical but also in a rich industrial and academical past.</p>
<p>Innovation isn&#8217;t a single big shot but rather a process of finding possibilities, contextualising them in domain/market, developing them for markets, and deploying them while thinking about concepts, markets or business model. So, it is not linear or sequential but the mix of parallel items &#8211; working on the ideas, evaluating in the market, building relationship at the same time. The innovation process is not just developing the idea or innovative design but applying them as the application on markets. To convert your idea into an opportunity, we need to execute both innovative concepts and applications on markets in time.</p>
<p>We should thrive to create our immediate environment and market rather than anticipate the evolution of the world, just like Telsa/Elon Musk did and PayPal did.</p>
<p>We should find the answers to the following questions as early as possible.</p>
<p>1. What are the relevant markets to test and deploy an innovation?</p>
<p>2. What is your team for this challenging voyage?</p>
<h5>Target long term, plan midterm, execute short term</h5>
<p>Plan speed and value indicators of the idea/product because, as you innovate, you target a long-term ambition while living in a short-term and planning in a medium term. You must plan for the time needed for the first demonstration of the innovation, the first marketing, applying to the other markets and taking it around the world.</p>
<h5>Value</h5>
<p>Along the innovation process, the value for the users and ourselves should be our top most priority. Value is often created with an innovative concept because it is innovation and can result in direct sales. Innovation can also increase the value of other products, add value to brands. We must balance and choose between low and high-value parts of the product/offering, this is the everyday story for all the innovators.</p>
<p>Innovation is is much more than a simple opportunity identification and involve the following key points.</p>
<h5>Type of innovation</h5>
<p>What is new in technology, architecture, and business model?</p>
<h5>Performance</h5>
<p>What are the factors to evaluate the innovation value that are characteristics of our idea/product?</p>
<h5>Process</h5>
<p>Who works on what for the innovation and how to build a strong relationship among people of your startup and its stakeholders (inside and outside both) &#8211; users, investors, industry research, academic research, etc.</p>
<p>A company used to spend huge money on advertisements, promotion and events but with the evolution of social media platforms like Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter, etc., this can be done by the users, so prepare a strategy to utilise these medias.</p>
