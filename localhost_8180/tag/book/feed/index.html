										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When learning about how to use a telescope and how to make one yourself, we came across a very good site [1] maintained by Will Kalif and were impressed by the content on the website, it is the culmination of years of experience and insights.</p>
<p>Later we got to know that Mr Will Kalif has also published a book on telescopes titled &#8220;See It with a Small Telescope: 101 Cosmic Wonders&#8221; and we thought to give it a try for our ventures into the night sky and for our readers. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Will received his first telescope as a Christmas present and motivated many people since then after feeling the joy of watching heavens himself.</span></p>
<p>After reading the book, the first thing come to mind is &#8211; to the point and clear. This book is written primarily for novice and amateurs, it introduces the concept at the basic level and expands it if it is required. Author motivates the amateurs not to give up, start small, and keep trying until it works.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book talks richness of the night sky f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rom the moon, to 60 million years far spiral galaxy, to cluster &#8211; like Galileo found them. The sky is not just filled with only s</span>tars but there are different objects galaxies, nebulae, planets, etc.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-935 size-large" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180528_003025_cp-1024x479.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="374" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will points that don’t compare your telescope experience with the Hubble but enjoy the pleasure of observing things yourself and appreciating it. Readers are</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> encouraged to read in sequence but you can skip to the chapter of interest based on your experience.</span></p>
<p>It is very important to set up your telescope in advance to let its optics adjust to the temperature and humidity, yes it adjusts. Most of the pictures used in the books are captured by small telescopes like 6” or less.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The book b</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rings clarity to the thoughts and the process of observation in a step by step manner. No extra fillers are used, the author talks directly to the point in a logical manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to know and use star charts and catalogues like Messier and NGC (New General Catalog) along with the details </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of magnitude and international convention of celestial coordinates with best viewing months, this book covers that too. You can start with e</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">asy to find objects like the moon, Jupiter, Saturn, M 13 globular, Andromeda and Orion nebula and then expand into deep sky objects slowly as they are covered in their own chapter.</span></p>
<p>The book is divided into 11 chapters with first 3 chapters are dedicated to the basics ranging from telescopes to astrophotography to our galaxy milky way.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-937 size-full" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/toc.jpg" alt="" width="594" height="650" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telescopes parts, filters, mounting and viewing technique are covered in basic details. Important researched items are also included like using the side of the eye than the centre (averted vision) along with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">common Q&amp;A like why and what to do when a telescope is having vibration, an object is in upside down position?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Piggybacking, afocal, prime focus, eyepiece projection photography techniques are also introduced to the readers in the book.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-931 size-large" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180527_152307_cp-1024x498.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="389" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Navigating the night sky by l</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ocating the cloudy band of the milky way, spotting Ursa (major and minor), Cassiopeia, Cygnus are covered in each separate chapters. The concept of e</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cliptic path containing all the planets and sun, the moon is very important one and the author has highlighted it on several occasions. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-933 size-large" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180528_003121_cp-1024x436.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="341" /></p>
<p>Overall the whole book is an interesting read and must be part of every beginner&#8217;s collection. Will has managed to bring in many years of his passion into a well defined and to the point content that readers will enjoy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wondering, what it takes to be the next google or the next big thing. I have few secrets to share with you so sit tight and read this post. How many of you knew Peter Thiel before reading this post? It&#8217;s fine if you don&#8217;t know, we don&#8217;t know many things in the world. I will tell you who is Peter and what advice he has for budding startups and new age entrepreneurs.</p>
<h4>PayPal Mafia</h4>
<p>Peter is part of PayPal mafia. Yes mafia, because the people in this group started their own successful multi-billion dollar startups like Uber, SpaceX, Linked, youtube, etc. Check them below, specially Thiel and Elon Musk. I will write about Elon Musk in due time. He along with Elon Musk sold their company PayPal to eBay for ~1.5 billion dollars.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-270" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/schermafbeelding-2016-03-15-om-20-09-26.png" alt="paypal mafia" width="500" height="432" />Peter also runs a startup program (Thiel fellowship) 20 under 20 [1] for startups with innovative ideas. This is good enough to increase your appetite for what is inside the book, let&#8217;s march ahead.</p>
<h4>Book Review</h4>
<p>In this book, Peter shares his experiences, experiments, and progress of industry from 2000s bubble (how it bloated and blasted) till recent times. His most important advice come to the importance of innovation for the startups or any business. Without innovation or new ideas, businesses are locked in competition and survival which doesn&#8217;t bring quick and positive change to the world. These businesses worry about their daily margin and put their maximum efforts on their earnings.</p>
<h4>Monopoly and Innovation</h4>
<p>Rather than relying solely on competition, companies should focus on new ideas to create monopoly just like google did. Google has captured the market even though it denies this argument and presents itself as a company in fierce competition. Google states that it has ~3% market share of ads business and less than 1% of the technology market. This argument helps it avoid strict scrutiny of competition laws. You will not believe, it captures more than 70% of the search engine market.</p>
<p>Being a monopoly is not bad otherwise, google would not have become what it is today &#8211; innovating in every corner of open problems and technologies, be it AI, consumer market (phones, chrome devices, android), and cloud, etc.</p>
<h4>Monopoly versus Competition</h4>
<p>Monopoly gives you time to focus on the things that businesses tangled in competition can&#8217;t achieve. These things can be employee benefits like free food, free dental cover, gym, flexible work, etc. These can also be working on new projects like driverless cars, project moon, etc. Thiel points out that competitive businesses tend to squeeze every efficiency out of everything. He mentions it is the reason you see grandma or grandpa working at the reception of many restaurants.</p>
<p>Monopoly drives new progress, see when Microsoft came in the market, it pushed IBM from the OS market and when Apple came it pushed Microsoft dominance down. Similarly, when Google came, it pushed Yahoo and Microsoft from their dominant stage of the tech and search business.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>This book gives powerful insights on how new startups should think and drive their strategy in doing something that is 10x better or totally new idea. From my experiences, it is by far one of the best books on startups.</p>
<p>Innovation is the key to enjoying the fruits and using those fruits to further drive innovation with wide social impact and change.</p>
