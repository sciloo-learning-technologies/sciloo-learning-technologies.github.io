										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In startup and in entrepreneur journey, people often go faster alone and they believe it too, but they go much further when they work together in a team. Even if you are very talented, your skills might not be enough for the project.</p>
<h5>Complementary skills and psychological aspects</h5>
<p>Complementing is a key skill and need in entrepreneurship. Be aware of your capabilities and skills to improve them more. Also be aware where you lag the skills and need other people assistance to pull the plug. Not only technical and functional skills are necessary but also the Social skills, qualities of each member will create a unique cocktail for the project or startup.</p>
<p>We will need innovation and agility capacities, an open mind, networking mindset, creativity and courage to take tough and decisive actions. Make fewer mistakes but it happens sometimes.</p>
<p>Select members who have these advantages given below.</p>
<h6>1. They love doing by iteration</h6>
<h6>2. Who will go beyond than already made solutions, crossing the set bar</h6>
<h6>3. With proven track record in the past</h6>
<p>Also, partners&#8217; personal goals and perspective matter and points are discussed below. These need to be discussed among the team and an understanding should be achieved so that people remain aligned and know each other motivation and purpose.</p>
<h5>Perspective &#8211; money</h5>
<p>How long can one survive with the money you have after investing in your startup? Keeping age, status, the way of life in mind and thinking in mind when deciding a partner. For some people money is aim but others it can only be an indicator of success. Both perspectives are fine if everybody is aware of these and agreement is reached among founders or partners.</p>
<h5>Background and awareness</h5>
<p>Check your partner&#8217;s support system &#8211; his background, networking, culture, education, journey to reach the current stage, honesty, etc.? Think about your venture or project in short term and long term while choosing your partner. Keep in mind that you can&#8217;t find all the qualities in a single person, you need to be aware of what you want to compromise on.</p>
<h5>Perspective- success</h5>
<p>How do you and your partner(s) define success?</p>
<p>1. Short term profit</p>
<p>2. Creating a brand that will live for years &#8211; like Google, Tesla, etc.</p>
<p>3. Size growth &#8211; want to be small or big</p>
<p>Make a list of your key indicators to success for the next years all partners may have different angles to success. For the venture to succeed you need to bring shared vision and goals.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have success and performance evaluation criteria then tasting the success is a tough chore. The challenges and direction that you want to plan and do together will bring directions to the team along with enthusiasm and motivation. This brings a meaning to short term plans and actions.</p>
<p>We often spend too much time learning how to work rather than facing and executing tough jobs together. Working on the challenges is the best way to know and test each other. Prepare for the worst so that you are ready and safeguard yourself before the real trouble starts where lots of people life and future is at stake. It is not telling you to be negative but it will help you plan alternative plans.  Fear of things is the best way to find solutions to them. Everybody fear but who control it they succeed.</p>
<h5>Conflict management</h5>
<p>Chaotic environment and start can get us more edge in performance as well as decision making as it forces you to doubt on your working style and to modify what can possibly go wrong. You will find missing learnings and checks with these challenges your success. The more we fix the things by thinking of the possible failures and by discussing things, the less impact the company face. Teams grow more in the adversity than in success. If the crisis is insurmountable, you will need to decide who is more likely to preserve the stakeholders. Remember that the one who has power in a relationship is the one who is ready to give up something. This person will need courage to change what can be changed and wisdom to accept what will never change.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Life &#8211; bag of happiness and sadness</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">life is filled with lots of surprises. It takes you to the top and brings down many times and you feel </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">both happy and sad. Nothing is permanent as we are Human. Our mood changes, our environment changes and it impacts us in positive and negative ways both.</span></p>
<h4>Feeling no ambition and value</h4>
<p>This story will tell your value to you in Life. <span style="font-weight: 400;">When things are tough and life seems to be difficult, it is easy to lose ambitions, to lose self-esteem, courage, love. You are broken, but is it really so? Ask yourself. Are you broken or you are confused about yourself.</span></p>
<h4>Story of Value &#8211; you are winner until you loose</h4>
<p>In a small distant town, there was a seminar going on where a huge number of people were gathered. It was not a formal seminar but a kind of social gathering and discussion. The gentleman on the stage start waving a 1000 Rs note and started asking the public who wants it. Not a surprise, nearly everybody wanted that note as it was coming free with no strings attached.</p>
<p>Then the person crumbled the note in his hands and again asked the same question &#8211; Who wants it now? Again, everybody raised their hands and public were about to push each other, everybody thinking they will get it.</p>
<p>Then to the surprise of all, the person took the notes and put it underneath his shoes and crushed it badly in dust. It became soiled and crumbled when he showed it to all. Here he comes again, Who wants it now? This time though not everybody but many people still wanted that note.</p>
<p>The person in charge of the note broke into a big laughter and then became sad with a slow body movement. He started speaking, you have seen today the value of this note, but I wanted to tell you something else with this story. I want to show your value to you all.</p>
<p>You and me are like this note, broken and stressed by Life many times over and over. You think that nobody wants you and you slowly get into depression thinking that you are worthless.</p>
<p>Still, there are people in your life who always want you and see value in you every time. They understand you are down but strong, they are always there for you.  Your value as a person like the note is still intact but it is our perception and comparison to the life of others that make us feel low and weak. Failures are temporary setbacks rather they are hidden big learning opportunities.</p>
<h4>Be a man of action &#8211; create your own destiny &#8211; write your own rules &#8211; success principles &#8211; Be the author of your life story</h4>
<p>Every person is valuable and has special strengths that it may have never focussed upon. You may not have stopped to break from a cycle of life that is continuous and deadly if you get into it. You need to bring all your focus into your ambitions and dreams to realise your true value. Be a child again. Live with this philosophy forever &#8211; I am fearless and a winner. You should have big dreams and ambition that drives you for the Life.  They can be any like starting a job, startup, social work, spending life with family. There is not a single straight line or defined path that we should all follow. We should follow our own hearts and create our own paths. Write your own destiny. Are you afraid of losing a job or becoming unstable &#8211; any way you are loosing life and your health that should have been more important?</p>
<p>Spend time with yourself, start feeling yourself, do hard work, be fearless &#8211; you will realise what you are capable of doing. Keep doing/flowing because actions generate value otherwise nobody like still stinky water.</p>
<p>Please share your life stories and experience in the comments section below or send us an email. We will share them on our platform for our readers to take learnings from your struggles and growth.</p>

<p>Check the famous personalities below if you are still down. Never say die and never give up.</p>
<p class="hed"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King">Stephen King</a> <img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-493 size-thumbnail" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/skic-cover-front-small-150x150.jpg" alt="stephen king" width="150" height="150" />&#8220;We are not interested in science fiction which deals with negative utopias. They do not sell.&#8221; Those were the words of one publisher who passed over the manuscript for &#8220;Carrie,&#8221; which King submitted when he was 20 years old. &#8220;Carrie&#8221; (iconic thriller) was rejected by 30 publishers, causing King to give up on it and throw it in the trash. His wife convinced Stephen to rework on it. The rest is history as you can search on google about this novel.</p>
<p class="hed">King has since published more than 50 books, all worldwide bestsellers and immensely successful. He was down but stood up and believed in his value.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-492 size-medium" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/list-disney-mickey-89856234-E-300x168.jpeg" alt="walt disney" width="300" height="168" /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney">Walt Disney</a> Walt Disney was fired from a newspaper for &#8220;not being creative enough.&#8221; One of his early ventures, called Laugh-o-gram Studios, went bankrupt after. The creator of Mickey and Minnie Mouse went on to be nominated for 59 Academy Awards, winning 32, all for his unparalleled animations.</p>
<p>He still holds the record for the most Oscars won by an individual. He knew his value and didn&#8217;t rely on someone else recognition for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-494 size-medium" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rs_1024x759-160126165827-1024.Oprah-Winfrey.ms_.012616-300x222.jpg" alt="oprah winfrey" width="300" height="222" /></p>
<p class="hed"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a> &#8216;The Oprah Winfrey Show&#8217; became one of the highest ranking shows in American history. Oprah&#8217;s was thrown out of the job being told that she was too emotional and not fit for television. Oprah was one of the best-paid females in the entertainment industry and remains the richest self-made woman and only black female billionaire.</p>
<p class="hed">He didn&#8217;t go down but kept fighting like the 1000 Rs note in the story above to retain its value and becoming successful.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a long and tiring career, an elderly carpenter was getting ready to retire. He told his head of his plans to leave the construction job and live a more peaceful life with his wife and the extended family. He said, I will miss the money, but I need to retire as I am tired of doing the same job daily and want to break out of it. The head was sad to see this good worker go and asked if he could build just one last house as a personal favour.</p>
<p>The carpenter said I will do it, but in time it was easy to see that his heart was not in his work. He started doing shoddy workmanship and used inferior materials. It was an unfortunate way to end a dedicated career. It also showed he was in haste and it affected his work.</p>
<p>When the carpenter finished his work, the head came to check the house. He handed the house keys to the carpenter. “This is your house,” he said, “my gift to you for all the hard work you did for me all the years along.”</p>
<p>The carpenter was shocked and sad! If he could have known early he was building his own house, he could have done it differently and nicely.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-473 size-medium" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mourning-77382_1280-300x169.jpg" alt="sad and thinking" width="300" height="169" /></p>
<p><strong>So it is with us. We build our lives, a day at a time, often putting less than our best into the building</strong>. Then with a shock, we realise we have to live in the house we have built. If we could do it again, we’d do it much differently. But we cannot go back.</p>
<p>You are the carpenter. Each day you hammer a nail, place a board, or erect a wall. Life is a do-it-yourself  &#8211; project. <strong>Your attitudes and the choices you make today will build the &#8220;house&#8221; you live in tomorrow. So better build it wisely!</strong></p>
<p>Put thought into your actions and choices/decisions as they will affect your outcomes. It doesn&#8217;t mean that you don&#8217;t live on your terms but you keep yourself aware of that your life is made of your decisions. The decisions you are taking now are as per the life you want to see not in the haste.</p>
<p>All the best, have a happy and successful life. Please share your views and real life examples in the comments section.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Your perception &#8211; successful people around you</strong></p>
<p>We all observe life around us and can&#8217;t stop us from thinking that how less capable or less hardworking people are ahead of you in terms of success and money or any other aspect of life. They can be your colleagues, boss or your neighbour, you interact with them almost daily and think that you are more talented than all them of them but still behind them in accomplishments (salary, promotions, house, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>The left out factor</strong></p>
<p>You are right and wrong at the same time. It is right in the sense that you are more capable but you are wrong thinking them less capable. You should be thinking how this can be the case of right wrong duality. There is a big difference that you have missed during your comparison or bias. The main factor that you miss everytime is Focus. If you go to the dictionary,  Focus is <em><strong>&#8220;the centre of interest or activity&#8221; or &#8220;adapt to the prevailing level of light and become able to see clearly&#8221;.</strong></em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-461" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BLFocus-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p><strong>Reasoning &#8211; Why Focus is the most important factor</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s understand why Focus is the single most important factor. It gives you clarity on what you want &#8211; you may want to go to a place for vacations or you may want to do a particular kind of job. Suppose you are confused in multiple choices and can&#8217;t focus on a place for vacations then how you will plan for it and when you will go there. Without the clear focus, you will not have any target and no timeline. Due to this, slowly you start loosing your interest and never achieve what you wanted.</p>
<p>What may be missing from your side can be the focus on your job or your life where as other people have put all their energy in a focused path and hence they seem to me more successful than you. They get more results as their efforts are more in a single direction whereas your efforts are distributed across multiple directions. The focus is not just visual or mental focus it also brings your energy into a focused set of actions that are aligned in a consistent direction. This focus not only is required for personal success but for <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/248563">business succes</a>s [1] also.</p>
<p><strong>How to improve it</strong></p>
<p>Now the question comes, how you can improve our focus. It is simple &#8211; it depends on of what you want in life. You have to decide as less as possible directions maximum 1 or 2 because our mind gets confused and loose interest beyond this. Then you should stop comparing two different lifestyles &#8211; focussed and varied. You should keep asking this question to the successful people about their mantra for success. Grow your observation on facts rather than biases.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t mean that if you like many things then you are wrong, it is also good in one way where you are getting satisfaction out of it and you are happily living. Then you should stop comparing two different lifestyles &#8211; focussed and distributed. Also, the Focus becomes more important in today&#8217;s internet rich world where you are continuously disturbed by notifications, SMS, calls, and emails, etc. You have to decide <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/your-brain-work/200910/easily-distracted-why-its-hard-focus-and-what-do-about-it">what you want to see (focus)</a> [2] not what the software (throwing you all kind of data) is throwing on you. This breaks your continuous attention on a subject/job/reading and you start wasting your time on internet/facebook/google searching unnecessary and unwanted things.</p>
<p>Stay focused start growing&#8230;</p>
