										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When you come to this article, it shows that you really want to understand what goes inside a business and how you can make it successful.</p>



<p>Business is not just about generating cash, earning, revenues, etc. Business is more about Customer first because any business <g class="gr_ gr_21 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="21" data-gr-id="21">generate</g> cash from customers. If customers <g class="gr_ gr_20 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="20" data-gr-id="20">doesn&#8217;t</g> trust your idea/products then your business days are in number. You should keep this trust alive for the whole life of your product. <g class="gr_ gr_185 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="185" data-gr-id="185">Customer</g> should understand what is buying and what is its reliability.</p>



<p>Approaches to a business</p>



<ol><li>Selling&nbsp;</li><li>Customer first</li></ol>



<p>When it is about just selling, you will ignore ethics, customer pain points and ultimately you will sell the products to many people. Nearly all of these customers today or tomorrow will realize the game played with them and then they will give factual details of what happened to others and then it spread like a fire. All your hard work and&nbsp;credibility can be at risk. When credibility is lost, it is really difficult to bring back because it is lost by behaviour which is difficult to correct. Recovery can be a painful and can be a&nbsp; lengthy process.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/05/27/00/58/trust-1418901__340.jpg" alt="" width="232" height="174"/></figure>



<p>When you keep customer first, then you are building trust with customer. You get a return of value (cash or trade) for your products. If customer feels this trust is broken it should be resolved to the customer satisfaction.&nbsp;As a business, you should not exist if you don&#8217;t exchange value. If you don&#8217;t return the value to the customer (product + mental satisfaction or trust) then it is better to not to do a business.</p>



<p>We follow the&nbsp;customer first approach at <g class="gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="4" data-gr-id="4">Sciloo</g> Learning Technologies. It looks simple in words but difficult to follow. You should be ready to incur financial loss in the few cases the and understand that is part of the learning and founding stone of a successful business.</p>



<p>In coming days, more articles will follow on different business aspects. We will target to solve a business&#8217;s problem and then explain the article rather than isolated concepts like marketing or selling etc.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The Core of any Business</h3>
<p>People don&#8217;t make more mistakes in management from wrong answers to right questions but from right answers to wrong questions, yet people generally spend more time finding the answer than identifying the relevant questions.</p>
<h3>3 Pillars of Startup</h3>
<ul>
<li>Expertise</li>
<li>Resources</li>
<li>Aspirations</li>
</ul>
<p>Should we adapt to find the strategy according to the resources or make the strategy and then identify the resources?</p>
<p>In a technical project &#8211; the priority of the founders and team are restricted by the finances as they are generally limited and way below the requirement. Let&#8217;s see on what principles strategy can be prepared.</p>
<h3>Four Fundamentals of Strategy</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Victory</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your goal must be not to be a marginal competitor expecting to hold 1 or 2% of the market share, it is equivalent to making the ambition marginal and also admitting implicitly that your innovation is not so powerful and attractive.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Build on strengths</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Identify the key strengths of your project/innovation, the characteristics that make it competitive and winning. Look for the points of differentiation which will make the difference with competitors. Invest in these key strengths to increase the difference.</p>
<p>Try to identify the weakness that makes you a real handicap against your competitors and invest to eliminate them and ignore the other weaknesses.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Risk estimation</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Any creative project includes risks, so this is not about eliminating them, but comprehend them and minimise them as much as possible. Dimensions below can be taken into consideration for this.</p>
<p>How reliable can changes in the environment be predicted?</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the degree of technological uncertainty? So, do we see clearly enough through space and time?</li>
<li>What is the degree of flexibility of the project?</li>
<li>Question your own strategy</li>
</ul>
<p>There is nothing worse than to keep going on a strategy that is already known to be doomed. You can&#8217;t win against the market, against the customers, against more powerful competitors.</p>
<p>First, you&#8217;ll try to adapt the project to environmental conditions by redefining:</p>
<ul>
<li>The target customers</li>
<li>The ways to reach them</li>
<li>Changing the business model if needed</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, it is very wise to stop a project at the right time, as instead of wearing yourself out pursuing an elusive goal, you can redirect the energy for a new project. Fail fast is the mantra you should imbibe.</p>
<h3>Market Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Volume Growth vs Value Growth</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The evolution of prices is derived from these two domains &#8211; volume and value. If the market is in volume growth, it is necessary to invest in capacity and financing of working capital. Also, the company should be able to rely on its profitability partially to support the prices.</p>
<p>The growth of a market usually follows an S-curve, it is stable in the start, then accelerate, and then stabilizes in the due course of time.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-987 alignleft" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/growth-300x247.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="247" /></p>
<p>The growth dynamics depend on two phenomena:</p>
<ul>
<li>Penetration</li>
<li>Consumption</li>
</ul>
<p>So the market can grow either by increasing the number of consumers using the product or by increasing their consumption.</p>
<p>Three fundamental questions remain to be answered clearly:</p>
<ul>
<li>How fast will the product get in the market? &#8211; delayed products give the edge to competitors to bring the similar products</li>
<li>Penetration levels at which growth can slow down? &#8211; after that what you should do</li>
<li>On what timescale &#8211; slow or fast?</li>
</ul>
<p>A market is rarely 100% saturated, you can always think about what is the maximum level of penetration that is possible?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Substitution</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, a startup arrives on the existing market with a more or less innovative offer. So it will present a substitute for what already exists.</p>
<p>You may think that your innovation will solve a very important health or safety problem,  customers should rush to buy your offer and leave their old behaviours behind. You will have to manage to substitute your offer to the old one, even if the old behaviour was not present or it was not to do anything. You will have to convince people to change.</p>
<p>The growth of your project will depend on the speed of this substitution. So it is important to understand the obstacles, the reluctances and to deeply analyse the decision-making process of the buyers.</p>
<p>Be aware of the psychological obstacles. Habits are hard to change because the consumers must unlearn a practice that always satisfied him/her and adopt a new technology, a new way of doing that carries risks which are sometimes too important.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Customer Behaviour</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Different kinds of consumers, so many distinct markets, several targets. So you must segment in order to refine the analysis and your business model.</p>
<p>What consequences can a forecasting error have?  Two major consequences appear. On a given date, incomes are not realised. The number of consumers, and so the sales revenue, are way below the forecast.</p>
<p>Pamper your first customers. They will be demanding, but they will help you develop your product, they will make you progress. Furthermore, they will be your most loyal defenders, and often your most effective advertisements.</p>
<p>After your first customers are satisfied or you can say short-term success, at the same time, make the necessary decisions to work with techniques to perfect the development of the product and its offerings, collect funds so that your project can continue and you can work on new ideas or improve the offerings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that you have learned about different types of formal businesses in India. We are going to focus on LLP from now on.</p>
<p>For a startup spending money at different steps of its journey is a crucial decision and can impact its resilience. Registering a company involves need following items:</p>
<ol>
<li>Filling out forms available online [1]</li>
<li>Verification of forms by CA (chartered accountants) or CS (company secretaries), etc. &#8211; incurs fee (depending upon their package)</li>
<li>Submitting to Govt. (physically or online) &#8211; luckily in India, each of the steps can be done online without moving physically anywhere</li>
<li>Paying the Govt. fee (MCA &#8211; Ministry of Corporate Affairs [1]).</li>
</ol>
<p>All of the above steps are taken care by many 3rd party companies which takes necessary documents from you (online) and collect money (online) and take all the burden away from your end to end. But they have fee starting from 7000 Rs. (as of March 2o17).</p>
<p>This fee includes their service charges, your digital signature, and all the Govt. fee (in case of LLP, it is below 1000 Rs for 2 people). Now comes the choice, can it be done yourself? The answer is yes and it is very easy.</p>
<p>You need to approach this whole process in a logical manner. All the details are given in MCA website and many articles on the web and will be explained here later.</p>
<p>But how to do it free (like free water we drink). Free in the sense that you can avoid 3rd party charges but you can&#8217;t avoid Gov. charges, digital signatures charges that are a must.</p>
<p>The first condition to get it done free is to hire a CA/CS free. Am I reading it right, hire a CA/CS free! Yes, otherwise how it will be free. Hire means you can find a close friend or relative, friends&#8217; friend, etc. who is CA/CS. Talk to him about your business and you can do something for that person later (either sending free product or service like website hosting, etc.).</p>
<p>There is a good chance that he will be able to do it free, but don&#8217;t forget to fulfil to return the help later.</p>

<li>Sole Propreitorship (Single person)</li>
<li>LLP (Limited Liability Partnership, 2+ persons)</li>
<li>Company (Private Ltd, 2+ people)</li>
</ol>
<p>Based on your requirement, you can choose any of the above. If you start business without registering, you can&#8217;t get many benefits a regular registerd business gets like credibility, value, financial support, govt schemes like startup India, etc.</p>
<h4>Sole Proprietorship</h4>
<p>A  single person is the owner and manages the company. This person is responsible for paying any losses in the business or his assets are sold to settle the debt. Tax is calculated as the tax on a normal income.</p>
<h4>LLP</h4>
<p>2 or more persons are the owners and take collective decisions. Assets of partners are safe and can&#8217;t be used to settle the debt. A flat 30% tax rate is applicable for LLP. Financial audit is not required if total income is less than 25 Lakh rs.</p>
<h4>Company</h4>
<p>2 or more persons are the owners and take collective decisions. Assets of partners are safe and can&#8217;t be used to settle the debt. A flat 30% tax rate is applicable for LLP. The only difference from LLP is that Pvt companies can have equity and can accept funding. Financial audit is necessary.</p>
<p>Registration of companies is done entirely on MCA (Ministry of Corporate Affairs) website. Now the questions come how we can register any of these free. I will give you a hint &#8211; connections.</p>
<p>I will cover the following details in the coming posts. I will especially take the example of LLP.</p>
<ol>
<li>Free Registration</li>
<li>Registrations steps (may be divided into several posts, even though it is simple)).</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We need to focus on the following two dimensions to ensure that our innovation has a future.</p>
<ol>
<li>Isolated or Systematic innovation</li>
<li>Creation or Substitution innovation</li>
</ol>
<h4>Isolated or Systematic innovation</h4>
<p>Innovation that works alone such as simple hand tools like Moka pot or pen. For the pen to make work you need a sheet of paper and that&#8217;s it. If the product is bit complex and is a part of production system such as design, development, verification in a process and reviewed regularly to maintain the quality, it is called systematic innovation. An example can be motor where different parts are acquired from different producers and assembled with the quality checks and other processes.</p>
<h4>Creation or Substitution innovation</h4>
<p>Your innovation can create a new market which is a difficult and rare phenomenon. Take an example of Google, which created a new market &#8211; search engine advertising and data analytics on the mass scale real behavioral data. What is the challenge, nobody knows it and we don&#8217;t know if there is a such market that exists or not. It is based on a latent need that we feel to be real but we are not sure.</p>
<p>On the opposite side, there is the substitution innovation representing the majority of the innovations. We compare the innovation features to the existing ones to judge which one is better. So it is kind of a reference system and the product/service will be placed for comparison. There are also obstacles to substitution &#8211; we need to check the consumers of our product whether they easily accept innovation or oppose it.</p>
<h4>Value created by my innovation</h4>
<p>It is the value perceived by the consumer. So, what is the value perceived by the consumer? It can be a trade-off &#8211; a compromise between the benefits that the consumer will perceive and the sacrifices linked to the innovation.</p>
<p>In some cases, it can be easy where customer understand the value because he can see the effects immediately but in some other cases, the perceived value will be way below reality. It is often the case for technological innovators &#8211; we speak of performance level, of technical challenges, whereas what interests the customer are the immediate benefits &#8211; the answer to his needs.</p>
<h4>Benefits for the customers</h4>
<ol>
<li>Money &#8211; You can save money with the innovation.</li>
<li>Time &#8211; I will save you time as mostly seen in software products.</li>
<li>Pain &#8211; It solves a problem that was not solved till now or was very difficult to do.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the three main benefits, the more we manage to combine, the better will be the value. The better will be the perceived value of our innovations. Show the facts and talk numbers rather talking in  the abstract terms about these 3 benefits and customers will appreciate the whole idea.</p>
<h4>Sacrifices for the customers</h4>
<ol>
<li>Transfer Costs</li>
<li>Risks</li>
<li>Unsustainability &#8211; such as a new startup can go out of business and responsibility anytime as they have not stayed in the market for a long time.</li>
</ol>
<p>We often overestimate the benefits and underestimate the sacrifices linked to the innovation.</p>
<h4>Be careful with self-centered analysis and try to have the views and opinions of the following actors</h4>
<ol>
<li>Consumers</li>
<li>Future Consumers</li>
</ol>
<p>The value perceived by the consumer in not uniform in all the markets. It is our responsibility to improve this value gradually by improving our product/service features and offerings. Start with the main targets first mainly verticals and then open the market progressively to other targets.</p>
<p>This value is not felt just by the end user (consumer) but often there is a range of consumers. If we use a supplier, the supplier will also need to find a value for himself, and it goes to the last consumer. Sometimes, the user finds a high value but the buyer doesn&#8217;t &#8211; solve it by creating value for each step of this consumer chain, for each stakeholder.</p>
<p>It can be different according to the different stakeholders but it must always exist and be taken care. Startups need to be aware of these dimensions early on.</p>
<p>Please share if you have any interesting story or experience for value creation and problem faced.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Managing an innovative projects focus on</p>
<ol>
<li>Reducing uncertainty by planning</li>
<li>Creating hypotheses</li>
<li>Get into action mode quickly to confirm or reject hypotheses</li>
<li>Convert hypotheses into knowledge &#8211; Discovery</li>
<li>Path to the discovery</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step is the coming up with hypotheses on</p>
<ol>
<li>Business model</li>
<li>Technology</li>
<li>Competition</li>
<li>Partners</li>
</ol>
<p>Each hypothesis will be tracked on following topics</p>
<ol>
<li>Its basis</li>
<li>Its effort estimation</li>
<li>Its owner</li>
<li>Its progress</li>
</ol>
<p>Critical hypotheses will also be identified that can affect several elements, has an important effect on performances, the feasibility of the project, important investments.</p>
<h4>Planning</h4>
<p>Milestones will also be planned where the main hypotheses will be discussed. For each milestone, there will be a target fixed &#8211; the hypotheses and the costs etc. Each milestone is used to validate at least one hypothesis, each hypothesis must be validated at least with one milestone, e.g. a critical milestone is used to validate a critical hypothesis.</p>
<h4>Acceptance</h4>
<p>From a hypothesis, design an experiment to</p>
<ol>
<li>Measure the gaps</li>
<li>learn and rephrase the hypothesis</li>
<li>Move to the next one</li>
</ol>
<p>Eric Ries recommends multiple of these learning loops and the reduction of their cost. These experiments require a minimum viable product that can be demonstrated. It isn&#8217;t a prototype, it is much simpler. The idea is to experiment the functionalities as soon as possible.</p>
<p>With early adopters accepting faults and actively participating to improve the product, you mustn&#8217;t specify it precisely, but let the missing features be underlined by negative feedbacks.</p>
<p>So you must organise these experiments early on and experiment often reduces the cost, set back the commitment of important and irreversible costs and multiply the methods to acquire knowledge. In other words, managing an innovative project is going the traditional way of project management but taking the uncertainties into account.</p>
<h4>Approach</h4>
<p>The structured and systematic approach should be followed. It is even more necessary in the case of an innovative project as cognitive bias have been identified by psychologists working on creators of innovative businesses and innovative project managers.</p>
<p>We often keep in mind information reinforcing the chosen hypotheses, reject information challenging these hypotheses. We tend to forget the hypothetical nature and the fragile baselines, overestimate success and undervalue risks.</p>
<p>We become optimistic and it is a good point. The role of managing tools of innovative projects is to go along with this optimism but through the structured and thorough tools leaving any bias</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>In the closing remarks, managing an innovative project means to work on three areas</p>
<ol>
<li>Grow knowledge and reduce uncertainties using multiple experiments</li>
<li>Build cohesion within the team</li>
<li>Bring common direction as the team may change as the project grows</li>
</ol>
<p>Please share your experience or ideas how we can manage these kinds of projects.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In startup and in entrepreneur journey, people often go faster alone and they believe it too, but they go much further when they work together in a team. Even if you are very talented, your skills might not be enough for the project.</p>
<h5>Complementary skills and psychological aspects</h5>
<p>Complementing is a key skill and need in entrepreneurship. Be aware of your capabilities and skills to improve them more. Also be aware where you lag the skills and need other people assistance to pull the plug. Not only technical and functional skills are necessary but also the Social skills, qualities of each member will create a unique cocktail for the project or startup.</p>
<p>We will need innovation and agility capacities, an open mind, networking mindset, creativity and courage to take tough and decisive actions. Make fewer mistakes but it happens sometimes.</p>
<p>Select members who have these advantages given below.</p>
<h6>1. They love doing by iteration</h6>
<h6>2. Who will go beyond than already made solutions, crossing the set bar</h6>
<h6>3. With proven track record in the past</h6>
<p>Also, partners&#8217; personal goals and perspective matter and points are discussed below. These need to be discussed among the team and an understanding should be achieved so that people remain aligned and know each other motivation and purpose.</p>
<h5>Perspective &#8211; money</h5>
<p>How long can one survive with the money you have after investing in your startup? Keeping age, status, the way of life in mind and thinking in mind when deciding a partner. For some people money is aim but others it can only be an indicator of success. Both perspectives are fine if everybody is aware of these and agreement is reached among founders or partners.</p>
<h5>Background and awareness</h5>
<p>Check your partner&#8217;s support system &#8211; his background, networking, culture, education, journey to reach the current stage, honesty, etc.? Think about your venture or project in short term and long term while choosing your partner. Keep in mind that you can&#8217;t find all the qualities in a single person, you need to be aware of what you want to compromise on.</p>
<h5>Perspective- success</h5>
<p>How do you and your partner(s) define success?</p>
<p>1. Short term profit</p>
<p>2. Creating a brand that will live for years &#8211; like Google, Tesla, etc.</p>
<p>3. Size growth &#8211; want to be small or big</p>
<p>Make a list of your key indicators to success for the next years all partners may have different angles to success. For the venture to succeed you need to bring shared vision and goals.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have success and performance evaluation criteria then tasting the success is a tough chore. The challenges and direction that you want to plan and do together will bring directions to the team along with enthusiasm and motivation. This brings a meaning to short term plans and actions.</p>
<p>We often spend too much time learning how to work rather than facing and executing tough jobs together. Working on the challenges is the best way to know and test each other. Prepare for the worst so that you are ready and safeguard yourself before the real trouble starts where lots of people life and future is at stake. It is not telling you to be negative but it will help you plan alternative plans.  Fear of things is the best way to find solutions to them. Everybody fear but who control it they succeed.</p>
<h5>Conflict management</h5>
<p>Chaotic environment and start can get us more edge in performance as well as decision making as it forces you to doubt on your working style and to modify what can possibly go wrong. You will find missing learnings and checks with these challenges your success. The more we fix the things by thinking of the possible failures and by discussing things, the less impact the company face. Teams grow more in the adversity than in success. If the crisis is insurmountable, you will need to decide who is more likely to preserve the stakeholders. Remember that the one who has power in a relationship is the one who is ready to give up something. This person will need courage to change what can be changed and wisdom to accept what will never change.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We need to elaborate the problems we are solving more clearly so that their solutions becomes transparent. We should not only be focusing on the technical part but also on validating the ideas and its reach. Henry Ford mass produced internal combustion engine and cars which were available only for few rich people earlier, he created a new market with significant social impacts.</p>
<p>You should identify the main stakeholders for your innovative idea or product. You must analyse and evaluate the resources, the process of these companies, as innovation often appears on the border of markets dominated by important actors. You could be partners or disruptions as the case may be. At this point, I demonstrated why I think that theories and practices you can do are not only topical but also in a rich industrial and academical past.</p>
<p>Innovation isn&#8217;t a single big shot but rather a process of finding possibilities, contextualising them in domain/market, developing them for markets, and deploying them while thinking about concepts, markets or business model. So, it is not linear or sequential but the mix of parallel items &#8211; working on the ideas, evaluating in the market, building relationship at the same time. The innovation process is not just developing the idea or innovative design but applying them as the application on markets. To convert your idea into an opportunity, we need to execute both innovative concepts and applications on markets in time.</p>
<p>We should thrive to create our immediate environment and market rather than anticipate the evolution of the world, just like Telsa/Elon Musk did and PayPal did.</p>
<p>We should find the answers to the following questions as early as possible.</p>
<p>1. What are the relevant markets to test and deploy an innovation?</p>
<p>2. What is your team for this challenging voyage?</p>
<h5>Target long term, plan midterm, execute short term</h5>
<p>Plan speed and value indicators of the idea/product because, as you innovate, you target a long-term ambition while living in a short-term and planning in a medium term. You must plan for the time needed for the first demonstration of the innovation, the first marketing, applying to the other markets and taking it around the world.</p>
<h5>Value</h5>
<p>Along the innovation process, the value for the users and ourselves should be our top most priority. Value is often created with an innovative concept because it is innovation and can result in direct sales. Innovation can also increase the value of other products, add value to brands. We must balance and choose between low and high-value parts of the product/offering, this is the everyday story for all the innovators.</p>
<p>Innovation is is much more than a simple opportunity identification and involve the following key points.</p>
<h5>Type of innovation</h5>
<p>What is new in technology, architecture, and business model?</p>
<h5>Performance</h5>
<p>What are the factors to evaluate the innovation value that are characteristics of our idea/product?</p>
<h5>Process</h5>
<p>Who works on what for the innovation and how to build a strong relationship among people of your startup and its stakeholders (inside and outside both) &#8211; users, investors, industry research, academic research, etc.</p>
<p>A company used to spend huge money on advertisements, promotion and events but with the evolution of social media platforms like Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter, etc., this can be done by the users, so prepare a strategy to utilise these medias.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We will see what kind of problems/misconceptions you can face in a tech startup. People get often confused between industry and market. There is a laser industry.However, there is no laser market. There is a welding market, a cutting market etc where lasers are used. Let&#8217;s discuss other important factors such as Market, Consumers and Offerings.&#8230; <a class="more-link" href="http://localhost:8180/2017/05/17/starting-a-technical-startup/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Starting a technical startup &#8211; evaluating the idea/opportunity</span></a>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We will see what kind of problems/misconceptions you can face in a tech startup. People get often confused between industry and market. There is a laser industry.However, there is no laser market. There is a welding market, a cutting market etc where lasers are used.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s discuss other important factors such as Market, Consumers and Offerings.</p>
<h5>Market</h5>
<p>As per economics, a market is a place where the price keeps supply and demand in check and balance. A market is a place where a certain amount of uses, functions, even desires exist which can be satisfied by the offerings. For example, the desire for clean hair is related to the hygienic but the desire to look beautiful which probably requires shampoo is not straightforward and easy to relate A shampoo which only accomplishes the first idea (to clean hair) doesn&#8217;t have a great value and is not expensive and can be prepared by a simple chemical formulation. A shampoo that can make you beautiful is not simple to make and can create a monopoly over the market.</p>
<h5>Users</h5>
<p>Who can afford the desire to look beautiful? Here comes the question of the use, the desire, and the user segmentation. We start from our invention, industry and then we transform it into use and desire. We then try to see the segmentation of the user group and have to think who can replace you (your product&#8217;s substitutions) or give you a competition.</p>
<p>A substitute may not do the same as your product but it can replace it. Let&#8217;s understand with an example, the first substitute to a shampoo is not a shampoo but the action of not doing anything &#8211; don&#8217;t wash my hair. `</p>
<p>Value is felt by the user so look at the value from the user point of view and don&#8217;t assume it yourself that the user will find the top value in your offerings.</p>
<p>If you are a startup company with an unparallel invention, such as a software, understanding the value is not a problem, it is your existence in coming years which the clients worry about that you will be gone out of business and their work will be held in the middle. Clients will prefer a low profile tech company which is less efficient but more long lasting. Look at the possible risks for your users and try to convince them.</p>
<h5>Offerings</h5>
<p>Products and offerings can be offered in either of the following dimensions.</p>
<h6>1. Position for innovation</h6>
<h6>2. Position for imitation</h6>
<h6>3. Position for adaptation</h6>
<h6>4. Reposition yourself again</h6>
<p>You need not follow a single direction out of the above list but it can change with time. Position your business with the utmost car, make it either low-end or high-end, don&#8217;t get confused with multiple directions. Get an advantage in one of the following dimensions but the pioneering spirit is a must to become the market leader and big success otherwise you will have to satisfy yourself being a follower.</p>
<h6>Technical edge</h6>
<p>Technological edge is not just a patent, it is also having experience and execution expertise. Without technical advantage, it is very difficult to become a pioneer in the market or industry.</p>
<h6>Scarce asset</h6>
<p>Physical assets, for example, if I have ~80% of the world&#8217;s phosphate sites, I am the leader in phosphate whatever happens.</p>
<h6>User behaviour &#8211; love for the brand</h6>
<p>Bring a differentiation to the users, it can be geographical or it can be in perception. You have to convince the users through perception may be in performance, look and feel, or savings etc.</p>
<p>And finally, to look credible, you need three rules given below.</p>
<p>Be comprehensible, it must be clear and significant for the buyer &#8211; either fewer risks or more value, or the right time.</p>
<p>It must have the possibility to gain value from the company on its value market, so check how the user value your product and company.</p>
<p>Safe from competition &#8211; it must defend against competition so that it brings something difficult to imitate and can create monopoly just like google and tesla.</p>
