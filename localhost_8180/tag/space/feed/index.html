<p><strong>Big bang</strong></p>



<p>Before big bang &#8211; <strong>Inflation </strong>(more or less dense universe) might have happened. 		Universe had violet expansion before hot big bang</p>



<p><strong>Theory of multiple universe </strong></p>



<p>Based on the trend of multiple stars, multiple galaxy, scientists think that Big bang keep happening always. Different universe have different physical laws</p>



<p>If there is difference in 4 forces strengths on earth life may not exist, it is a merely coincidence.</p>



<p><strong>Theory of one universe</strong></p>



<p>Our universe expand and then contracts to create a big bang again, this theory is called the  T<strong>heory of Eternal Universe.</strong><br></p>



<p><strong>Fate of the universe &#8211; how it will end</strong><br></p>



<p>Second law of thermodynamics,  with time things gets more disordered.<br></p>



<p><strong>Birth of Stars</strong></p>



<p>First stars started shining after 100 Million years of Big Bang. But Sun was born after 9 Billions year of Big Bang. 1.1 Billions years from 2018, it will become 10% brighter</p>



<p>3 Billions years from 2018 it will be 4X brighter and ocean will be no more</p>



<p>Star formation rate has slowed down to half from 10billions year to today.</p>



<p>Our Sun will become red giant which will engulf the mercury and earth all and then collapse in to a dense mass which will never create a star and will lock the matter forever</p>



<p><strong>Black holes</strong></p>



<p> In milky way lies a super massive black hole 4 Millions X sun mass. 2 to 3 X mass of sun, stars become black hole</p>



<p><strong>Theory of big rip</strong></p>



<p> When space starts expanding, keep expanding. Dark energy keep becoming strong and keep tearing matter apart.</p>



<p><strong>Inflationary multiverse</strong></p>



<p> Even though our universe dies but new universes keep coming. Our research can become like religion books in far future world.</p>



<p>People will not be able to reproduce what is written in scientific books or papers<br></p>



<p>GW170817, first documented collision of two neutron stars using LIGO</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When learning about how to use a telescope and how to make one yourself, we came across a very good site [1] maintained by Will Kalif and were impressed by the content on the website, it is the culmination of years of experience and insights.</p>
<p>Later we got to know that Mr Will Kalif has also published a book on telescopes titled &#8220;See It with a Small Telescope: 101 Cosmic Wonders&#8221; and we thought to give it a try for our ventures into the night sky and for our readers. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Will received his first telescope as a Christmas present and motivated many people since then after feeling the joy of watching heavens himself.</span></p>
<p>After reading the book, the first thing come to mind is &#8211; to the point and clear. This book is written primarily for novice and amateurs, it introduces the concept at the basic level and expands it if it is required. Author motivates the amateurs not to give up, start small, and keep trying until it works.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book talks richness of the night sky f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rom the moon, to 60 million years far spiral galaxy, to cluster &#8211; like Galileo found them. The sky is not just filled with only s</span>tars but there are different objects galaxies, nebulae, planets, etc.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-935 size-large" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180528_003025_cp-1024x479.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="374" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will points that don’t compare your telescope experience with the Hubble but enjoy the pleasure of observing things yourself and appreciating it. Readers are</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> encouraged to read in sequence but you can skip to the chapter of interest based on your experience.</span></p>
<p>It is very important to set up your telescope in advance to let its optics adjust to the temperature and humidity, yes it adjusts. Most of the pictures used in the books are captured by small telescopes like 6” or less.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The book b</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rings clarity to the thoughts and the process of observation in a step by step manner. No extra fillers are used, the author talks directly to the point in a logical manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to know and use star charts and catalogues like Messier and NGC (New General Catalog) along with the details </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of magnitude and international convention of celestial coordinates with best viewing months, this book covers that too. You can start with e</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">asy to find objects like the moon, Jupiter, Saturn, M 13 globular, Andromeda and Orion nebula and then expand into deep sky objects slowly as they are covered in their own chapter.</span></p>
<p>The book is divided into 11 chapters with first 3 chapters are dedicated to the basics ranging from telescopes to astrophotography to our galaxy milky way.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-937 size-full" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/toc.jpg" alt="" width="594" height="650" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telescopes parts, filters, mounting and viewing technique are covered in basic details. Important researched items are also included like using the side of the eye than the centre (averted vision) along with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">common Q&amp;A like why and what to do when a telescope is having vibration, an object is in upside down position?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Piggybacking, afocal, prime focus, eyepiece projection photography techniques are also introduced to the readers in the book.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-931 size-large" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180527_152307_cp-1024x498.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="389" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Navigating the night sky by l</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ocating the cloudy band of the milky way, spotting Ursa (major and minor), Cassiopeia, Cygnus are covered in each separate chapters. The concept of e</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cliptic path containing all the planets and sun, the moon is very important one and the author has highlighted it on several occasions. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-933 size-large" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180528_003121_cp-1024x436.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="341" /></p>
<p>Overall the whole book is an interesting read and must be part of every beginner&#8217;s collection. Will has managed to bring in many years of his passion into a well defined and to the point content that readers will enjoy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever wondered why don&#8217;t we see stars and planets in the daytime on earth? One day, a curious kid was asking question after seeing Jupiter in the early hours that where this Jupiter is gone now, why we can&#8217;t see it. I was enthralled and at the same time happy to see such curiosity. This is what differentiate us from animals.<br />
Then I thought, is this question valid in space particularly if we are standing on the moon? It becomes more interesting when moon come into the picture. So this question can be divided into two parts.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why we can&#8217;t see stars in daytime on earth?</li>
<li>Is this phenomenon only observable on earth, what about the moon?</li>
</ol>
<p>Firstly, lets understand the reason of this behaviour on earth. As we know, earth has atmosphere with dust particles and other particles which scatter the sun light all over the earth atmosphere and create a blue colour in the sky which has more brightness than stars in the background. But some time we can see moon in the day time, it is because moon is a very bright object and its brightness is still more than earth&#8217;s blueish sky.</p>
<p>For explaining the question 2, lets imagine if you are standing on the moon. Do you think the same behaviour will apply on moon? We will find shortly if you are right or wrong.</p>
<p>We should notice that Moon doesn&#8217;t have a atmosphere and no particles to scatter light. This results in Sun and stars visible in day time. You can see stars both in day (Figure 1) and night (Figure 2) on the moon. It is really interesting behaviour which is difficult to understand at first but if you understand how light behave, things become easy. We will cover the light/optics in details in coming posts. So, it is the result of light scattering on earth and absence of this process on moon that gives us the answer.</p>

<p>Please comment what do you think of this behaviour and do you know any other place in space which has more strange behaviour than earth and moon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stargazing is the best part of our workshop. Kids were invited along with parents to share their joy and aha moments. Every child enjoyed the observation of stars and planets. They observed the craters and the surface of the moon. Some planets like Jupiter and moon of Jupiter were shown to the kids and their parents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their excitement and rain of questions and discussions about the earth, the sun, and the universe gave us the happiness we always look for &#8211; the pleasure of finding things out and observing.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Observed stellar objects</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Moon surface</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Jupiter and one of its 67 moons</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kids learn by feeling the real things or their physical model rather than virtual things like image, video, etc. Physical interactions improve their motor and sensory skills too and create the joy of learning.</p>
<h4>Space in our life</h4>
<p>Nearly everybody is touched by Space in today&#8217;s times and can not deny the excitement when they hear the terms space, Nasa, ISRO, etc. We dream ourselves or our kids going there as scientists or leaders. We always search for opportunity to fulfil this excitement either through the visits of science/technology center (such as <a href="http://www.taralaya.org/">Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium</a>, <a href="http://www.vismuseum.gov.in/">Vishveshwarya Technical Museum</a>, <a href="http://www.hal-india.com/Heritage%20Centre%20and%20Aerospace%20Museum/M__20">HAL</a>)</p>
<h4>Solar System Model</h4>
<p>We always want to have a science kit especially a solar system model all the time to teach our kids about earth, sun, and space. One such model is shown below that is very realistic compared to the models available in the market, it was made using plastic balls and water-colours by our kid. The sun was made with football to mark the size difference. All planets were painted with their distinct surface texture. This model is really useful to demonstrate the different concepts like the solar eclipse, lunar eclipse, planet rotation. See the actual model below.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-509" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/solar-system.jpg" alt="solar system" width="533" height="400" /></p>
<h4>Learnings</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This model tells the kids about our solar system, planets, their distance from the sun, orbits, texture of their surfaces. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have eight planets in our solar system which rotates around the sun. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1st four planets Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars are rocky planets being composed of rock and metals. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jupiter and Saturn are called Gas Giants, being composed of mainly hydrogen and helium. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two outer planets Uranus and Neptune are called Ice Giants, mainly composed of ices such as water, ammonia and methane.</span></p>
<h4>Imagination Exercise</h4>
<p>To raise your curiosity, let&#8217;s visualise the scenario that I have written down.</p>
<p>The Earth is constantly rotating around its axis at approx. 1700 km/h. One more interesting thing to know, it is moving in its orbit around the Sun at nearly 107000 km/h. Have you felt this motion ever? And our <span class="highlightNode">solar</span> system is moving in Milky way galaxy at nearly 800000 km per hour. And I am sure on the road you feel scared when moving on a bike or in a car above 100 km/h.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-510 size-full alignleft" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/The-sun-is-moving.gif" alt="moving solar system" width="497" height="280" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-512 alignnone" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/solar-apex-188166156-300x232.jpg" alt="front view solar system movement" width="375" height="290" /></p>
<p>Share your views in the comments &#8211; what do you think about this scenario and did you know it already. What topics you want to cover in this platform, please provide your suggestions.</p>

<p>It looks so natural to us that we don&#8217;t question why we are able to do this marvellous feat every day. Are we ignorant? I believe, No. Then, do we think it is too complex not to ponder the attention, No? Then what is the reason, we are caught up in so many activities and earning our livelihood that we forget to ask questions.</p>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s see &#8211; sound mechanism</strong><br />
Sound needs a medium because these are propagated through the disturbance in the matter (air particles). On the other hand, there is the vacuum in space i.e there is no material medium. We are not totally true here, there is a presence of particles in space but that is very less dense and sparse. Due to this, particles don&#8217;t transfer their movements (disturbance) to other particles. That&#8217;s the reason, natural speaking and listening are very very difficult.</p>

<p><strong>How do they do it then?</strong><br />
An astronaut can only talk using radio communication systems involving a transmitter and receiver placed in their suits. This system works on radio waves which are EMW (Electromagnetic Waves) which can travel through the vacuum. No need to fear from the term EMW, it is the name given to the range of vibrations (cosmic rays to microwaves) which doesn&#8217;t need any material to travel. Vibration is a disturbance in something (to and fro), see the figure below for an example. The rope is moving from its position due to pulling and coming back, you can see the disturbance/wave travelling.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Space suit and its value</strong><br />
Coming back to the topic, using this system, sound signals can be transmitted as radio waves which can be directed as desired. There is no atmosphere outside an astronaut&#8217;s space suit when he is outside in space. They can&#8217;t simply go out and talk to each other (we will cover it in another post). Astronaut&#8217;s space suit also maintain atmospheric conditions for the astronaut.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are few times when you come into contact with something and feel the magic and aura in its surroundings. Rakesh Sharma, India&#8217;s first astronaut is an example of such enigmatic and charismatic personality.</p>
<p><strong>The legend was born</strong><br />
It was the day of January 13, 1949, when this former Indian Air Force test and HAL (Hindustan Aeronautics Limited) chief test pilot for LCA (light combat aircraft) was born in Patiala, Punjab.</p>
<p>He was not only famous for his space voyage but during the 1971 war,<br />
he showed tremendous mettle when flew many missions of great successes in MIG-21.</p>
<p><strong>Training and Journey to Space</strong><br />
His journey started when he was selected on 20th September 1982 for cosmonaut and was trained extensively for the next 18 months for the 8-day trip to Space with the Russians.</p>
<p>The take-off from Baikonur/Moscow on April 2, 1984, brought Indo-Soviet relations to a great level of closeness. The Soyuz IT–11 took 3 people including Ship’s Commander Y.V. Malyshev and Flight Engineer G.M. Strekalov to the Salyut-7 orbiting Space Station.</p>
<p><strong>Moments in Space Station</strong><br />
The crew spent seven days inside the station during which they conducted scientific and technical studies including 43 experimental sessions. His work was mainly in the fields of biomedicine and remote sensing. He also studied the effectiveness of Yoga in weightlessness. He took photographs for northern part of India in a mission to find suitable sites for nuclear plant installations.</p>
<p>Cosmonauts are trained the most to cope with the effects of zero gravity on the body and mind. Sharma, while giving a lecture in Bangalore on the kind of training that is given to astronauts, recalled that they were all made to sleep with their heads lower than their feet.</p>
<p><strong>Power of Yoga</strong><br />
Sharma says that six months before the launch, he dropped the fitness regime that the other cosmonauts were following and started intensive yoga. This was to assess whether yoga helps people cope better with the lack of gravity.</p>

<p><strong>Our India is Best</strong><br />
While he was in space, then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in a famous conversation asked him how does India look from space, Sharma replied “Saare Jahan Se Achcha” meaning ‘the Best in the world’.</p>
<p><strong>Honours</strong><br />
Several honours such as the honour of Hero of Soviet Union upon his return from the space, Ashoka Chakra by Indian Govt. were conferred on him. He took early retirement as wing commander from IAF (Indian Air Force).</p>
