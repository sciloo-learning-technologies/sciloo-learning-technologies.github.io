<p><g class="gr_ gr_19 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="19" data-gr-id="19">Inspiration</g> for this article &#8211;  <strong>Roberta B. Ness (worked on Ovarian Cancer)</strong></p>



<p>Even though in today’s world we are more eager to invent and do more but innovation in healthcare and many other sectors like water treatment, garbage cleaning etc. is very slow for example there is no cheap cancer treatment, <g class="gr_ gr_105 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="105" data-gr-id="105">cost-effectiveness</g> of other medical treatments, etc.<br></p>



<p>Frames define our thinking, the kind of expectations in a particular situation. Frames are cognitive and emotions expectations and can also result in reactions. For example &#8211; you are expecting a hello from a person meeting you the first time, instead, he tells you who are you?</p>



<p>This breaks the flow or assumptions in your thinking.</p>



<p><strong>Frame</strong></p>



<p style="text-align:left">To innovate &#8211; we must break frames. Scientists used to assume that bacteria can’t grow in acidic environment of the stomach, break this assumptions and check the data to explain anomalies.</p>



<p><strong>Observation</strong></p>



<p>To be an innovator &#8211; you must be a great observer.</p>



<p><strong>Flipping the view</strong></p>



<p>God creates every creature to perfection, Darwin flipped it and said it is not <g class="gr_ gr_29 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling" id="29" data-gr-id="29">perfection</g> and <g class="gr_ gr_40 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="40" data-gr-id="40">lets</g> find the reason for it. </p>



<p>Darwin imagined himself as plant to understand the evolution.</p>



<p><strong>Analogy</strong></p>



<p>What is the cause, cells that are around ovarian are same as in breathing pipe (airway<g class="gr_ gr_10 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation multiReplace" id="10" data-gr-id="10">).</g> Is there can be <g class="gr_ gr_31 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="31" data-gr-id="31">reason</g> that smoking can also affect ovary like our airways.</p>



<p><strong>Élie Metchnikoff </strong>&#8211; the discovery of white blood cell (tried suicide 2 times, believed in Darwin theory). He did put a thorn in a fish and found white blood cells around it to protect from the attack. Read about this great scientist to know of his thinking approach.<br></p>



<p><strong>Be bold not cautious. </strong></p>



<p>World need innovation rather than invention for the sake of patent filing. We need to improve the world and solve problems rather than settle in life.<br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This article shows one of our founder&#8217;s passion about the art of coffee making and drinking. Firstly, you should recognize that costly equipment will not give you a great cup of coffee if you don&#8217;t put efforts in fine tuning the process that ultimately affects the taste. Just check the video below to get the feel of complete process.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Coffee experiments using bottomless basket portafilter" width="750" height="422" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ijSMLYm2AAo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h3>Coffee making process</h3>
<ol>
<li>Getting coffee (roasted whole bean or grounded)</li>
<li>Grinding</li>
<li>Brewing machine and brewing</li>
<li>Milk frothing</li>
<li>Feeling the taste</li>
<li>Refine the process</li>
</ol>
<p>Lets cover each of them one by one.</p>
<h3>1. Getting the coffee</h3>
<p>This is the first step in the process and can have biggest impact on the taste because  these coffee beans will be brewed and give the taste. Coffee is grown in different parts and heights of the world, this brings a variation in taste across different produce of coffee. Try different coffee beans before you find your taste, take the risk of trying as many as different coffee beans (imagining about the taste and aroma they can produce).</p>
<h3>2. Grinding</h3>
<p>This is also very important step and can impact the taste if you don&#8217;t understand it well. Grinding should be smooth and grounded coffee should be near equal size parts. If we use a normal blade mixer then it will not create a smooth grind, it creates coarse on the top and very fine at the bottom, along with this, it will add a burning taste to the coffee due to the blade friction.</p>
<p>Burr grinders are the most suitable tool as of now for grinding, specifically ceramic burr grinders because they don&#8217;t burn coffee beans. We have used Hario clear grinder which is manual and can be a headache some time when you want quick coffee. There are several automatic coffee grinders in the markets like Bartazza, Delonghi, etc.</p>
<h3>3. Brewing machine and brewing</h3>
<p>Just like other steps, it is also very important step as it involves bringing the actual coffee out from the grounded beans. Machine should provide atleast basic function like prefusion, pressure control, brew temperature control, milk frothing hose.</p>
<p>Coffee machines at the lower price levels come with pressurized baskets which may not be give you the taste as per your liking, so you need to either go for non pressurized machines or make a non pressurized basket by removing the second layer. Prefusion is a very essential step which makes grounded coffee damp so that when the hot water comes after that all the oil from coffee and crema comes easily with the flow.</p>
<h3>4. Milk frothing</h3>
<p>Milk frothing should be done with full steam and cold milk (experts recommend milk with cream without boiling but we got good result from the cream removed milk after boiling and cooling in refrigerator). Bubbles created during the frothing should be removed by tamping the frothing jug or cup on a surface. Milk should look like a smooth creamy flow not a soapy with bubbles (even small also) all around.</p>
<h3>5. Feeling the taste</h3>
<p>After frothing, you can make either latte/cappuccino (depending upon your taste &#8211; add more or less milk) or you can have espresso shot directly. Coffee is best tasted in white small cups with flat or round base. The reason is, in white cup, we can feel the coffee color clearly and it is pleasant to our eyes. During your first sip of the coffee, close your eyes and feel the aroma and taste. Have a healthy discussion on coffee or sit in solace.</p>
<h3>6. Refine the process</h3>
<p>In case you don&#8217;t get your coffee right in first time, repeat the process again with steps fine tuned again till you get a desired taste. As I said in the beginning, it is an art in the sense that you have to feel it to make it right and create a masterpiece every time. It is a science in the sense, to get a good coffee you need to understand the basics of coffee beans, machines, prefusion and why it is necessary, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will add the reference to each steps in coming days in this article. Share your coffee story and the memories and experiences you have about and with coffee.</p>

<p>A teacher needs to recognize that they&#8217;re not working alone, It&#8217;s very easy for teachers to become isolated within their classrooms and also with their problems.</p>
<p>A few years back, teachers used to feel happy to go to seniors (head/principal) and talk openly about the problems they were facing, but now it is very difficult to think and do. Now, we live in a situation in schools in which people and the idea of collaboration are slowly disappearing.</p>
<p>Teaching is about learning and developing certain skills, certain competencies and keeping certain strategies at your disposal. Without empathy and considerations about social economic backgrounds of students, these competencies become very unhelpful for teachers and it produces a very limited idea of what teaching is.</p>
<p>But without questions, there are going to be no answers. And so the importance of asking questions is being recognized and a lot more now. We always remember a teacher who has touched us in some way. For a good teacher, children think he is one of them and one of us too. Teaching isn&#8217;t just about certain skills, competencies, strategies, etc., there&#8217;s something else that is also required.</p>
<h4>Reflective Practice</h4>
<p>Reflection practice challenges assumptions that we bring with us into teaching and it questions us how we should do things differently in a better way. It reinforces our belief in what we do. Challenging our assumption is very difficult thing to do because we don&#8217;t know what our assumptions are and that&#8217;s the reason they&#8217;re called assumptions.</p>
<p>During our lifetime we develop certain mental frameworks &#8211; ways of understanding the world, experiencing the world. new experiences, new information. Instead of changing the way we look at the world, we try to manipulate this new experience to challenge it. We try to manipulate it in such a way that we can fit it into our existing understandings. You know, I think we all understand how, how we do this. and, you know, these are our assumptions.</p>
<p>If we don&#8217;t challenge our assumptions, we would always just stay the way that we are and nothing grows with us.</p>
<h4>Reflexive teaching</h4>
<p>Reflexivity encourages us to understand our practice in relation to the society/the world in which we live. We should understand how our students socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds have an impact on how they experience schooling.  It is not about thinking just ourselves in isolation, about our personal qualities, our competencies, it&#8217;s about developing an understanding of the impact of students lives outside of school, on the way they are and the way they learn inside the school. It would include, for example, understanding the impact of emotions on students.</p>
<p>Understanding behavior more in terms of what happens outside of school and developing appropriate ways of dealing with not just dismissing someone&#8217;s behavior as bad, or unacceptable. We may feel we need to punish bad behavior but teaching is about trying to understand it in terms of a student&#8217;s wider life. We cannot just treat our emotions as things that we can just dump any place conveniently. We carry them with us all the time, we are humans.</p>
<p>The most important thing we&#8217;re encouraged to leave out the classroom or interaction our feelings &#8211; Teachers are not supposed to have feelings. This is wrong. We need to support our kids emotionally by understanding why they are behaving in a particular manner by asking questions so that they can explain.</p>
<p>We need to be an ear to them who don&#8217;t ignore them and listen to them with embrace and compassion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Build on &#8211; expose the world to them</h4>
<p>Find out what your child actually knows and understands, rather than assuming. Asking them good questions would expose many misconceptions and misunderstandings about the world to them. Imagine with little older kids, if we&#8217;re talking about the earth rotation, its orbit, our solar system, they can tell us what is earth and other planets. But can they tell what causes an eclipse? Make better questioning part of life by asking open-ended questions that give us evidence about what and how does this kid understand or not understand.</p>
<h4>Make base strong &#8211; don&#8217;t feed them</h4>
<p>They might tell that the sun is moving around the earth and not the other way which is wrong but hold on. Also ask, why is it night in India when it&#8217;s day in the USA. You&#8217;ll expose them to some very basic scientific fundamentals that you can build on. Kids can come up with totally weird answers and we tend to correct them with the right answers. Rather we should ask them where did they get the answer from, how did they think about it? If you keep feeding them right answers you might never know what is wrong in their thinking process and how they arrive at a particular answer.</p>
<h4>Big picture and Feedback</h4>
<p>As parents, we should show them the bigger picture to make them understand what&#8217;s going on here. It is a very critical piece in their life and growth as they might not connect with the bigger picture when they are doing something. It can affect their interest and motivation.</p>
<p>Another very important area where the parents must be involved all the time is feedback. What kind of feedback do you give? Most of the time it empty and useless feedback. Feedback should be very specific and task focussed and should produce a set of corrective actions.</p>
<p>See the sports coaches, they diagnose whatever the particular sportsperson is doing well and not doing well and then focuses in on the things they need to improve. The importance of the big picture and growth in a skill are very critical aspects of feedback.</p>
<p>Help kids in know what are they doing, why are they doing and how they can make sense of it. It&#8217;s kind of chess board game, If you know the rules of the game, if you can spot the patterns, you&#8217;ve got a much more powerful memory than if all you&#8217;re trying to remember a few pieces and games that you already played.</p>
<h4>Imagination</h4>
<p>Help them imagine what will it be like if they are successful (doing something they love and want to do)? Many successful people imagine themselves doing things and dreaming about achieving the goals and the life they want to have, coach the kids with this principle &#8211; imagining, believing, working and achieving.</p>
<h4>Ability or disability induction</h4>
<p>Don&#8217;t focus on the word or rather forget the word &#8211; ability, rather work with kind of apprenticeship model, where you talk about somebody being naive, novice, apprentice, expert, master as they learn, do, and progress.</p>
<p>Life is a learning process, it is about the work itself not about the kid. Ability is all about reputations, labels, and that really interferes with how teachers and schools treat kids. The biggest difference between a good teacher and a normal teacher is the level of the cognitive demand of the work they set their kids, all the kids.</p>
<p>Expert/good teachers expect more from all of their kids, not just the bright ones. They expect them to do deep learning work which is understanding themselves, making sense of it for themselves. So stay away from the word ability and demand more of our children, all the children.</p>
<p>If you’re told that you are high ability or low ability, It doesn’t take you far for certainly. But If you are told that you can do something well or you can do something better, it gives you a lot of possibilities and opportunities.</p>
<p>By putting kids into ability groups is very harmful, kids at the top get the more imaginative, better, more creative and kids at the bottom are treated as they&#8217;re not going to do well. Kids at the bottom are event told that you are less capable and not in the same league. The gap widens with time and distorts the thinking process and confidence of kids. It is like we are writing a script for them at that point about what they can and can&#8217;t do without really testing it out, without really giving them opportunities, without understanding them.</p>
<p>Kids (ours and others) are like flowers and nature, each has its own beauty and variations, we should nurture it rather than segregating them and damaging them to the core.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5>Forceful learning</h5>
<p>kids know better how they learn rather than somebody teaching/telling them how to learn. Teachers should create an environment for allowing kids to discuss how they learn better and talk openly. But this is not the case in most of the institutions as most of the focus is on forcefully broadcasting textbooks via mouth and not creating a conducive and collaborative environment. The possible reasons can be, it takes more time and energy and it can impact revenue per kid or they have never thought of it.</p>
<p>This clearly shows one signal that particular school or institution either doing it intentionally or unintentionally. If it is intentional then future of kids are in risky hands and if it is unintentional then again the future of kids are in risky hands as the people in charge don&#8217;t do research about learning and don&#8217;t learn themselves.</p>
<p>Kids are very delicate, a proper environment should be provided to them to nurture with freedom as well as discipline. They should feel free to talk openly and not scared of the teachers. I have seen kids including at my home, they are so afraid of teacher and think that they will only do work as given by the teacher and not other work as we are not teachers.</p>
<p>There is a general principle of active learning (<a href="http://weatherhead.case.edu/executive-education/instructors/david-kolb">David Kolb</a>) given below.</p>
<pre><strong>(do -&gt; review -&gt; learn -&gt; apply )</strong>

<strong>+ with many reflection cycles (for understanding how did you tackle the task and what learning you can take to do it better next time)</strong></pre>
<p>There are few misconceptions about what makes a better learner, let&#8217;s discuss them in the section below.</p>
<h5>The misconceptions about better learner</h5>
<p>It is very hard to formulate that study harder makes a better learner. We don&#8217;t fully understand peoples&#8217; different backgrounds, family culture as well as their social networking and these all things also affect the learning goals and reach. Take the example of Einstein who was kicked out of school and failed many exams but this didn&#8217;t affect his learning and output.</p>
<p>So we can say that a good learner is a person who&#8217;s always open to learning, networking, taking risks. We need to read research about learning to understand better what is going on the field and what are the latest findings on learning. This will help us in imbibing those learning in our learning approach and it may add value to the existing methodologies that we are following.</p>
<h5>Approach</h5>
<p>We need to learn on our own and then discuss the learning in a group, it can be in person or on a social platform like online forums, Whatsapp, Facebook, etc. Learning is impactful if it is done in groups that are collaborating and interacting with each other frequently. Along with learning, collaboration builds social skills which in-turn make learning more enjoyable and strong with top notch output.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learning can be divided into 4 parts and greatly depends on the learner&#8217;s purpose.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5><strong>Learning to know</strong></h5>
<p>Reading, enquiry, etc.</li>
<li>
<h5><strong>Learning to do</strong></h5>
<p>Building a model, tool, etc.</li>
<li>
<h5><strong>Learning to live in society</strong></h5>
<p>Studying the life and behaviour of life and society to live</li>
<li>
<h5><strong>Learning to be self-aware</strong></h5>
<p>Awareness of our mind, body, etc. to live a happy and healthy life</li>
</ol>
<p>Being scared or more disciplined may hinder the learning process and critical thinking for us and especially kids as they are learning the world around them. Kids should be provided with a comfortable and approachable environment where they should be free to use diverse methods for thinking and collaborating.</p>
<h4>Traditional classroom</h4>
<p>Traditionally classroom teaching or learning is more focussed on maintaining silence where kids are told not to speak and interact loudly to each other. This environment hampers their brain development in the long run. Kids are even scolded and given punishment for speaking differently than teachers. You would remember the scene (linked below) from PK movie that signifies that this even prevails in universities.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="What is a machine? - Funny scene | 3 Idiots | Aamir Khan | R Madhavan | Sharman Joshi" width="750" height="422" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-MlkASchodc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Traditional classrooms or even today&#8217;s classrooms have teachers to<a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.ENRL.TC.ZS"> students ratio ~1:30 or more</a> and this means personalised learning is not inherently possible as a teacher have too many students to reach and teach. This result in a coercive method (mostly one way from teacher to students) which is harmful to learning.</p>
<h4>Authority versus Authoritarian</h4>
<p>Teachers become authoritarian (running their own rules, forceful way of teaching, punishment, etc.) instead of authority on the subjects (expert in their fields). This way of working is not healthy for open thinking and discussions. Kids are scared to even to speak simple things and their growth becomes stagnant.</p>
<h4>New model &#8211; Progressive</h4>
<p>There is a need for the new model called progressive, personalised,  or constructive teaching. These paradigms focus that kids make meaning and understand things by experiencing themselves. They make sense of their surroundings and world, the teacher can act as a catalyst to spark the excitement and curiosity. This spark is the most important impression that will be with them all their life and guide their thought process and actions.</p>
<p>Please share your thoughts in the comment section or by reaching to us. We are planning to start a revolution in the way kids are taught and they learn. Keep an eye for the announcement in coming months from us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Life &#8211; bag of happiness and sadness</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">life is filled with lots of surprises. It takes you to the top and brings down many times and you feel </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">both happy and sad. Nothing is permanent as we are Human. Our mood changes, our environment changes and it impacts us in positive and negative ways both.</span></p>
<h4>Feeling no ambition and value</h4>
<p>This story will tell your value to you in Life. <span style="font-weight: 400;">When things are tough and life seems to be difficult, it is easy to lose ambitions, to lose self-esteem, courage, love. You are broken, but is it really so? Ask yourself. Are you broken or you are confused about yourself.</span></p>
<h4>Story of Value &#8211; you are winner until you loose</h4>
<p>In a small distant town, there was a seminar going on where a huge number of people were gathered. It was not a formal seminar but a kind of social gathering and discussion. The gentleman on the stage start waving a 1000 Rs note and started asking the public who wants it. Not a surprise, nearly everybody wanted that note as it was coming free with no strings attached.</p>
<p>Then the person crumbled the note in his hands and again asked the same question &#8211; Who wants it now? Again, everybody raised their hands and public were about to push each other, everybody thinking they will get it.</p>
<p>Then to the surprise of all, the person took the notes and put it underneath his shoes and crushed it badly in dust. It became soiled and crumbled when he showed it to all. Here he comes again, Who wants it now? This time though not everybody but many people still wanted that note.</p>
<p>The person in charge of the note broke into a big laughter and then became sad with a slow body movement. He started speaking, you have seen today the value of this note, but I wanted to tell you something else with this story. I want to show your value to you all.</p>
<p>You and me are like this note, broken and stressed by Life many times over and over. You think that nobody wants you and you slowly get into depression thinking that you are worthless.</p>
<p>Still, there are people in your life who always want you and see value in you every time. They understand you are down but strong, they are always there for you.  Your value as a person like the note is still intact but it is our perception and comparison to the life of others that make us feel low and weak. Failures are temporary setbacks rather they are hidden big learning opportunities.</p>
<h4>Be a man of action &#8211; create your own destiny &#8211; write your own rules &#8211; success principles &#8211; Be the author of your life story</h4>
<p>Every person is valuable and has special strengths that it may have never focussed upon. You may not have stopped to break from a cycle of life that is continuous and deadly if you get into it. You need to bring all your focus into your ambitions and dreams to realise your true value. Be a child again. Live with this philosophy forever &#8211; I am fearless and a winner. You should have big dreams and ambition that drives you for the Life.  They can be any like starting a job, startup, social work, spending life with family. There is not a single straight line or defined path that we should all follow. We should follow our own hearts and create our own paths. Write your own destiny. Are you afraid of losing a job or becoming unstable &#8211; any way you are loosing life and your health that should have been more important?</p>
<p>Spend time with yourself, start feeling yourself, do hard work, be fearless &#8211; you will realise what you are capable of doing. Keep doing/flowing because actions generate value otherwise nobody like still stinky water.</p>

<p>Check the famous personalities below if you are still down. Never say die and never give up.</p>
<p class="hed"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King">Stephen King</a> <img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-493 size-thumbnail" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/skic-cover-front-small-150x150.jpg" alt="stephen king" width="150" height="150" />&#8220;We are not interested in science fiction which deals with negative utopias. They do not sell.&#8221; Those were the words of one publisher who passed over the manuscript for &#8220;Carrie,&#8221; which King submitted when he was 20 years old. &#8220;Carrie&#8221; (iconic thriller) was rejected by 30 publishers, causing King to give up on it and throw it in the trash. His wife convinced Stephen to rework on it. The rest is history as you can search on google about this novel.</p>
<p class="hed">King has since published more than 50 books, all worldwide bestsellers and immensely successful. He was down but stood up and believed in his value.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-492 size-medium" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/list-disney-mickey-89856234-E-300x168.jpeg" alt="walt disney" width="300" height="168" /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney">Walt Disney</a> Walt Disney was fired from a newspaper for &#8220;not being creative enough.&#8221; One of his early ventures, called Laugh-o-gram Studios, went bankrupt after. The creator of Mickey and Minnie Mouse went on to be nominated for 59 Academy Awards, winning 32, all for his unparalleled animations.</p>
<p>He still holds the record for the most Oscars won by an individual. He knew his value and didn&#8217;t rely on someone else recognition for it.</p>

Oprah was one of the best-paid females in the entertainment industry and remains the richest self-made woman and only black female billionaire.</p>
<p class="hed">He didn&#8217;t go down but kept fighting like the 1000 Rs note in the story above to retain its value and becoming successful.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Your perception &#8211; successful people around you</strong></p>
<p>We all observe life around us and can&#8217;t stop us from thinking that how less capable or less hardworking people are ahead of you in terms of success and money or any other aspect of life. They can be your colleagues, boss or your neighbour, you interact with them almost daily and think that you are more talented than all them of them but still behind them in accomplishments (salary, promotions, house, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>The left out factor</strong></p>
<p>You are right and wrong at the same time. It is right in the sense that you are more capable but you are wrong thinking them less capable. You should be thinking how this can be the case of right wrong duality. There is a big difference that you have missed during your comparison or bias. The main factor that you miss everytime is Focus. If you go to the dictionary,  Focus is <em><strong>&#8220;the centre of interest or activity&#8221; or &#8220;adapt to the prevailing level of light and become able to see clearly&#8221;.</strong></em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-461" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BLFocus-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p><strong>Reasoning &#8211; Why Focus is the most important factor</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s understand why Focus is the single most important factor. It gives you clarity on what you want &#8211; you may want to go to a place for vacations or you may want to do a particular kind of job. Suppose you are confused in multiple choices and can&#8217;t focus on a place for vacations then how you will plan for it and when you will go there. Without the clear focus, you will not have any target and no timeline. Due to this, slowly you start loosing your interest and never achieve what you wanted.</p>
<p>What may be missing from your side can be the focus on your job or your life where as other people have put all their energy in a focused path and hence they seem to me more successful than you. They get more results as their efforts are more in a single direction whereas your efforts are distributed across multiple directions. The focus is not just visual or mental focus it also brings your energy into a focused set of actions that are aligned in a consistent direction. This focus not only is required for personal success but for <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/248563">business succes</a>s [1] also.</p>
<p><strong>How to improve it</strong></p>
<p>Now the question comes, how you can improve our focus. It is simple &#8211; it depends on of what you want in life. You have to decide as less as possible directions maximum 1 or 2 because our mind gets confused and loose interest beyond this. Then you should stop comparing two different lifestyles &#8211; focussed and varied. You should keep asking this question to the successful people about their mantra for success. Grow your observation on facts rather than biases.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t mean that if you like many things then you are wrong, it is also good in one way where you are getting satisfaction out of it and you are happily living. Then you should stop comparing two different lifestyles &#8211; focussed and distributed. Also, the Focus becomes more important in today&#8217;s internet rich world where you are continuously disturbed by notifications, SMS, calls, and emails, etc. You have to decide <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/your-brain-work/200910/easily-distracted-why-its-hard-focus-and-what-do-about-it">what you want to see (focus)</a> [2] not what the software (throwing you all kind of data) is throwing on you. This breaks your continuous attention on a subject/job/reading and you start wasting your time on internet/facebook/google searching unnecessary and unwanted things.</p>
<p>Stay focused start growing&#8230;</p>
