<p><g class="gr_ gr_19 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="19" data-gr-id="19">Inspiration</g> for this article &#8211;  <strong>Roberta B. Ness (worked on Ovarian Cancer)</strong></p>



<p>Even though in today’s world we are more eager to invent and do more but innovation in healthcare and many other sectors like water treatment, garbage cleaning etc. is very slow for example there is no cheap cancer treatment, <g class="gr_ gr_105 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="105" data-gr-id="105">cost-effectiveness</g> of other medical treatments, etc.<br></p>



<p>Frames define our thinking, the kind of expectations in a particular situation. Frames are cognitive and emotions expectations and can also result in reactions. For example &#8211; you are expecting a hello from a person meeting you the first time, instead, he tells you who are you?</p>



<p>This breaks the flow or assumptions in your thinking.</p>



<p><strong>Frame</strong></p>



<p style="text-align:left">To innovate &#8211; we must break frames. Scientists used to assume that bacteria can’t grow in acidic environment of the stomach, break this assumptions and check the data to explain anomalies.</p>



<p><strong>Observation</strong></p>



<p>To be an innovator &#8211; you must be a great observer.</p>



<p><strong>Flipping the view</strong></p>



<p>God creates every creature to perfection, Darwin flipped it and said it is not <g class="gr_ gr_29 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling" id="29" data-gr-id="29">perfection</g> and <g class="gr_ gr_40 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="40" data-gr-id="40">lets</g> find the reason for it. </p>



<p>Darwin imagined himself as plant to understand the evolution.</p>



<p><strong>Analogy</strong></p>



<p>What is the cause, cells that are around ovarian are same as in breathing pipe (airway<g class="gr_ gr_10 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation multiReplace" id="10" data-gr-id="10">).</g> Is there can be <g class="gr_ gr_31 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="31" data-gr-id="31">reason</g> that smoking can also affect ovary like our airways.</p>



<p><strong>Élie Metchnikoff </strong>&#8211; the discovery of white blood cell (tried suicide 2 times, believed in Darwin theory). He did put a thorn in a fish and found white blood cells around it to protect from the attack. Read about this great scientist to know of his thinking approach.<br></p>



<p><strong>Be bold not cautious. </strong></p>



<p>World need innovation rather than invention for the sake of patent filing. We need to improve the world and solve problems rather than settle in life.<br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of us know that Edison holds around 1084 patent but do you know he doesn&#8217;t have the highest number of patents. The highest number of patents at the time of this writings are 5183, almost 5 times than Edison&#8217;s. In this article, I will summarize my learnings from one of such inventors &#8211; Mark Johnson [2] (holds more than 500 patents, but not on the list).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-953 size-full" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/patents.jpg" alt="" width="689" height="457" /></p>
<p>From here on, the article will present as if Mark Johnson is talking to you directly.</p>
<h3>Start</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t learn to be an inventor, I was interested in s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">olving problem, got the first assignment with the deadline of 3 months. I worked for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 months on vibration reduction from the magnetic tape in tape recorder and player. After that, I worked on f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">errite core transformer (having small size but high frequencies) for ~4 years.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nobel prize years</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was working on the similar technologies ( Giant magnetoresistance [3] ) for which- Nobel prize was awarded, this invention had applications in the video recorder, hard disk, etc. and ultimately used to shrink the size of these devices and many more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was important because it is highly sensitive (low magnetic force high resistance change) and gives easy detection.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moores law &#8211; increase in no of inventions per year by Mark</span></h3>
<p>I initially worked on materials and then my organization thought I should focus on display now as we were focussing on TV display or general purpose display in Philips. When we started working on display we got the following.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lcd &#8211; 20 patent</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oled &#8211; 40 patent</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">e-ink &#8211; 100 patents</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Still, we were not leaders in display technologies.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were working on the Flat panel, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low power reflective display and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inventors were leading the planning and executions of these project rather than project management guys. My c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">olleague invented 3 out of 10 display technologies in the market but those were not where we could earn the money for the business. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in AMOLED technology, we were the 2nd company to work out the technology and build the first working model.</span></p>
<p>During these years, I noticed that I was filing patents double than the previous year just like CPU power is doubled every year.</p>
<h3>Paper-like display</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were the first on paper like display &#8211; building the prototype and developing a working technology. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon was taking e-ink display from a company which was using license of this Philips technology (there were 100s of patents) from Philips.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big challenge </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then we needed to come up with next big challenges and after utilizing the experience and literature we came to following topics where work could be done.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neuroscience </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emotions</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reconnaissance</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We needed to work on high-risk high reward ideas but the first step was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hypothesis testing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; fail hypothesis fastest. We picked later different ideas ranging from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food, hair to teeth whitening which was very successful.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Process of inventions</span></h3>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">First scope</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, the idea to implement or patent</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Problems &#8211; how to solve them</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior art &#8211; value of the tech, competitors</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">determine the approach </span>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    No art &#8211; direct patent</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    Some &#8211; workaround</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    Much art  avoid or circumvention (use TRIZ technique)</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find a specific problem that valuable control points</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about 5 to 10 years in future</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evaluate on feasibility, novelty, desirability</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The format of a patent</span></h3>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspiration</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short description</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illustration of invention</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Main tech feature</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Main prior art</span></li>
</ol>
<h3>Advice</h3>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work out of your comfort zone</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">No need to be expert, just do your work</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Material patents are most valuable</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spread out across teams and projects to best spread the process (instead of passive communication or emails)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inexperienced team can be productive with the well laid out process</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be the first to spot and get problems &#8211; snatch opportunities</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listening to the experience of 20-30 years is better than one or two sessions on current technology.</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In startup and in entrepreneur journey, people often go faster alone and they believe it too, but they go much further when they work together in a team. Even if you are very talented, your skills might not be enough for the project.</p>
<h5>Complementary skills and psychological aspects</h5>
<p>Complementing is a key skill and need in entrepreneurship. Be aware of your capabilities and skills to improve them more. Also be aware where you lag the skills and need other people assistance to pull the plug. Not only technical and functional skills are necessary but also the Social skills, qualities of each member will create a unique cocktail for the project or startup.</p>
<p>We will need innovation and agility capacities, an open mind, networking mindset, creativity and courage to take tough and decisive actions. Make fewer mistakes but it happens sometimes.</p>
<p>Select members who have these advantages given below.</p>
<h6>1. They love doing by iteration</h6>
<h6>2. Who will go beyond than already made solutions, crossing the set bar</h6>
<h6>3. With proven track record in the past</h6>
<p>Also, partners&#8217; personal goals and perspective matter and points are discussed below. These need to be discussed among the team and an understanding should be achieved so that people remain aligned and know each other motivation and purpose.</p>
<h5>Perspective &#8211; money</h5>
<p>How long can one survive with the money you have after investing in your startup? Keeping age, status, the way of life in mind and thinking in mind when deciding a partner. For some people money is aim but others it can only be an indicator of success. Both perspectives are fine if everybody is aware of these and agreement is reached among founders or partners.</p>
<h5>Background and awareness</h5>
<p>Check your partner&#8217;s support system &#8211; his background, networking, culture, education, journey to reach the current stage, honesty, etc.? Think about your venture or project in short term and long term while choosing your partner. Keep in mind that you can&#8217;t find all the qualities in a single person, you need to be aware of what you want to compromise on.</p>
<h5>Perspective- success</h5>
<p>How do you and your partner(s) define success?</p>
<p>1. Short term profit</p>
<p>2. Creating a brand that will live for years &#8211; like Google, Tesla, etc.</p>
<p>3. Size growth &#8211; want to be small or big</p>
<p>Make a list of your key indicators to success for the next years all partners may have different angles to success. For the venture to succeed you need to bring shared vision and goals.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have success and performance evaluation criteria then tasting the success is a tough chore. The challenges and direction that you want to plan and do together will bring directions to the team along with enthusiasm and motivation. This brings a meaning to short term plans and actions.</p>
<p>We often spend too much time learning how to work rather than facing and executing tough jobs together. Working on the challenges is the best way to know and test each other. Prepare for the worst so that you are ready and safeguard yourself before the real trouble starts where lots of people life and future is at stake. It is not telling you to be negative but it will help you plan alternative plans.  Fear of things is the best way to find solutions to them. Everybody fear but who control it they succeed.</p>
<h5>Conflict management</h5>
<p>Chaotic environment and start can get us more edge in performance as well as decision making as it forces you to doubt on your working style and to modify what can possibly go wrong. You will find missing learnings and checks with these challenges your success. The more we fix the things by thinking of the possible failures and by discussing things, the less impact the company face. Teams grow more in the adversity than in success. If the crisis is insurmountable, you will need to decide who is more likely to preserve the stakeholders. Remember that the one who has power in a relationship is the one who is ready to give up something. This person will need courage to change what can be changed and wisdom to accept what will never change.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We need to elaborate the problems we are solving more clearly so that their solutions becomes transparent. We should not only be focusing on the technical part but also on validating the ideas and its reach. Henry Ford mass produced internal combustion engine and cars which were available only for few rich people earlier, he created a new market with significant social impacts.</p>
<p>You should identify the main stakeholders for your innovative idea or product. You must analyse and evaluate the resources, the process of these companies, as innovation often appears on the border of markets dominated by important actors. You could be partners or disruptions as the case may be. At this point, I demonstrated why I think that theories and practices you can do are not only topical but also in a rich industrial and academical past.</p>
<p>Innovation isn&#8217;t a single big shot but rather a process of finding possibilities, contextualising them in domain/market, developing them for markets, and deploying them while thinking about concepts, markets or business model. So, it is not linear or sequential but the mix of parallel items &#8211; working on the ideas, evaluating in the market, building relationship at the same time. The innovation process is not just developing the idea or innovative design but applying them as the application on markets. To convert your idea into an opportunity, we need to execute both innovative concepts and applications on markets in time.</p>
<p>We should thrive to create our immediate environment and market rather than anticipate the evolution of the world, just like Telsa/Elon Musk did and PayPal did.</p>
<p>We should find the answers to the following questions as early as possible.</p>
<p>1. What are the relevant markets to test and deploy an innovation?</p>
<p>2. What is your team for this challenging voyage?</p>
<h5>Target long term, plan midterm, execute short term</h5>
<p>Plan speed and value indicators of the idea/product because, as you innovate, you target a long-term ambition while living in a short-term and planning in a medium term. You must plan for the time needed for the first demonstration of the innovation, the first marketing, applying to the other markets and taking it around the world.</p>
<h5>Value</h5>
<p>Along the innovation process, the value for the users and ourselves should be our top most priority. Value is often created with an innovative concept because it is innovation and can result in direct sales. Innovation can also increase the value of other products, add value to brands. We must balance and choose between low and high-value parts of the product/offering, this is the everyday story for all the innovators.</p>
<p>Innovation is is much more than a simple opportunity identification and involve the following key points.</p>
<h5>Type of innovation</h5>
<p>What is new in technology, architecture, and business model?</p>
<h5>Performance</h5>
<p>What are the factors to evaluate the innovation value that are characteristics of our idea/product?</p>
<h5>Process</h5>
<p>Who works on what for the innovation and how to build a strong relationship among people of your startup and its stakeholders (inside and outside both) &#8211; users, investors, industry research, academic research, etc.</p>
<p>A company used to spend huge money on advertisements, promotion and events but with the evolution of social media platforms like Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter, etc., this can be done by the users, so prepare a strategy to utilise these medias.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We will see what kind of problems/misconceptions you can face in a tech startup. People get often confused between industry and market.

Let&#8217;s discuss other important factors such as Market, Consumers and Offerings.&#8230; <a class="more-link" href="http://localhost:8180/2017/05/17/starting-a-technical-startup/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Starting a technical startup &#8211; evaluating the idea/opportunity</span></a>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We will see what kind of problems/misconceptions you can face in a tech startup. People get often confused between industry and market. There is a laser industry.However, there is no laser market. There is a welding market, a cutting market etc where lasers are used.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s discuss other important factors such as Market, Consumers and Offerings.</p>
<h5>Market</h5>
<p>As per economics, a market is a place where the price keeps supply and demand in check and balance. A market is a place where a certain amount of uses, functions, even desires exist which can be satisfied by the offerings. For example, the desire for clean hair is related to the hygienic but the desire to look beautiful which probably requires shampoo is not straightforward and easy to relate A shampoo which only accomplishes the first idea (to clean hair) doesn&#8217;t have a great value and is not expensive and can be prepared by a simple chemical formulation. A shampoo that can make you beautiful is not simple to make and can create a monopoly over the market.</p>
<h5>Users</h5>
<p>Who can afford the desire to look beautiful? Here comes the question of the use, the desire, and the user segmentation. We start from our invention, industry and then we transform it into use and desire. We then try to see the segmentation of the user group and have to think who can replace you (your product&#8217;s substitutions) or give you a competition.</p>
<p>A substitute may not do the same as your product but it can replace it. Let&#8217;s understand with an example, the first substitute to a shampoo is not a shampoo but the action of not doing anything &#8211; don&#8217;t wash my hair. `</p>
<p>Value is felt by the user so look at the value from the user point of view and don&#8217;t assume it yourself that the user will find the top value in your offerings.</p>
<p>If you are a startup company with an unparallel invention, such as a software, understanding the value is not a problem, it is your existence in coming years which the clients worry about that you will be gone out of business and their work will be held in the middle. Clients will prefer a low profile tech company which is less efficient but more long lasting. Look at the possible risks for your users and try to convince them.</p>
<h5>Offerings</h5>
<p>Products and offerings can be offered in either of the following dimensions.</p>
<h6>1. Position for innovation</h6>
<h6>2. Position for imitation</h6>
<h6>3. Position for adaptation</h6>
<h6>4. Reposition yourself again</h6>
<p>You need not follow a single direction out of the above list but it can change with time. Position your business with the utmost car, make it either low-end or high-end, don&#8217;t get confused with multiple directions. Get an advantage in one of the following dimensions but the pioneering spirit is a must to become the market leader and big success otherwise you will have to satisfy yourself being a follower.</p>
<h6>Technical edge</h6>
<p>Technological edge is not just a patent, it is also having experience and execution expertise. Without technical advantage, it is very difficult to become a pioneer in the market or industry.</p>
<h6>Scarce asset</h6>
<p>Physical assets, for example, if I have ~80% of the world&#8217;s phosphate sites, I am the leader in phosphate whatever happens.</p>
<h6>User behaviour &#8211; love for the brand</h6>
<p>Bring a differentiation to the users, it can be geographical or it can be in perception. You have to convince the users through perception may be in performance, look and feel, or savings etc.</p>
<p>And finally, to look credible, you need three rules given below.</p>
<p>Be comprehensible, it must be clear and significant for the buyer &#8211; either fewer risks or more value, or the right time.</p>
<p>It must have the possibility to gain value from the company on its value market, so check how the user value your product and company.</p>
<p>Safe from competition &#8211; it must defend against competition so that it brings something difficult to imitate and can create monopoly just like google and tesla.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learning can be divided into 4 parts and greatly depends on the learner&#8217;s purpose.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5><strong>Learning to know</strong></h5>
<p>Reading, enquiry, etc.</li>
<li>
<h5><strong>Learning to do</strong></h5>
<p>Building a model, tool, etc.</li>
<li>
<h5><strong>Learning to live in society</strong></h5>
<p>Studying the life and behaviour of life and society to live</li>
<li>
<h5><strong>Learning to be self-aware</strong></h5>
<p>Awareness of our mind, body, etc. to live a happy and healthy life</li>
</ol>
<p>Being scared or more disciplined may hinder the learning process and critical thinking for us and especially kids as they are learning the world around them. Kids should be provided with a comfortable and approachable environment where they should be free to use diverse methods for thinking and collaborating.</p>
<h4>Traditional classroom</h4>
<p>Traditionally classroom teaching or learning is more focussed on maintaining silence where kids are told not to speak and interact loudly to each other. This environment hampers their brain development in the long run. Kids are even scolded and given punishment for speaking differently than teachers. You would remember the scene (linked below) from PK movie that signifies that this even prevails in universities.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="What is a machine? - Funny scene | 3 Idiots | Aamir Khan | R Madhavan | Sharman Joshi" width="750" height="422" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-MlkASchodc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Traditional classrooms or even today&#8217;s classrooms have teachers to<a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.ENRL.TC.ZS"> students ratio ~1:30 or more</a> and this means personalised learning is not inherently possible as a teacher have too many students to reach and teach. This result in a coercive method (mostly one way from teacher to students) which is harmful to learning.</p>
<h4>Authority versus Authoritarian</h4>
<p>Teachers become authoritarian (running their own rules, forceful way of teaching, punishment, etc.) instead of authority on the subjects (expert in their fields). This way of working is not healthy for open thinking and discussions. Kids are scared to even to speak simple things and their growth becomes stagnant.</p>
<h4>New model &#8211; Progressive</h4>
<p>There is a need for the new model called progressive, personalised,  or constructive teaching. These paradigms focus that kids make meaning and understand things by experiencing themselves. They make sense of their surroundings and world, the teacher can act as a catalyst to spark the excitement and curiosity. This spark is the most important impression that will be with them all their life and guide their thought process and actions.</p>
<p>Please share your thoughts in the comment section or by reaching to us. We are planning to start a revolution in the way kids are taught and they learn. Keep an eye for the announcement in coming months from us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Your perception &#8211; successful people around you</strong></p>
<p>We all observe life around us and can&#8217;t stop us from thinking that how less capable or less hardworking people are ahead of you in terms of success and money or any other aspect of life. They can be your colleagues, boss or your neighbour, you interact with them almost daily and think that you are more talented than all them of them but still behind them in accomplishments (salary, promotions, house, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>The left out factor</strong></p>
<p>You are right and wrong at the same time. It is right in the sense that you are more capable but you are wrong thinking them less capable. You should be thinking how this can be the case of right wrong duality. There is a big difference that you have missed during your comparison or bias. The main factor that you miss everytime is Focus. If you go to the dictionary,  Focus is <em><strong>&#8220;the centre of interest or activity&#8221; or &#8220;adapt to the prevailing level of light and become able to see clearly&#8221;.</strong></em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-461" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BLFocus-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p><strong>Reasoning &#8211; Why Focus is the most important factor</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s understand why Focus is the single most important factor. It gives you clarity on what you want &#8211; you may want to go to a place for vacations or you may want to do a particular kind of job. Suppose you are confused in multiple choices and can&#8217;t focus on a place for vacations then how you will plan for it and when you will go there. Without the clear focus, you will not have any target and no timeline. Due to this, slowly you start loosing your interest and never achieve what you wanted.</p>
<p>What may be missing from your side can be the focus on your job or your life where as other people have put all their energy in a focused path and hence they seem to me more successful than you. They get more results as their efforts are more in a single direction whereas your efforts are distributed across multiple directions. The focus is not just visual or mental focus it also brings your energy into a focused set of actions that are aligned in a consistent direction. This focus not only is required for personal success but for <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/248563">business succes</a>s [1] also.</p>
<p><strong>How to improve it</strong></p>
<p>Now the question comes, how you can improve our focus. It is simple &#8211; it depends on of what you want in life. You have to decide as less as possible directions maximum 1 or 2 because our mind gets confused and loose interest beyond this. Then you should stop comparing two different lifestyles &#8211; focussed and varied. You should keep asking this question to the successful people about their mantra for success. Grow your observation on facts rather than biases.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t mean that if you like many things then you are wrong, it is also good in one way where you are getting satisfaction out of it and you are happily living. Then you should stop comparing two different lifestyles &#8211; focussed and distributed. Also, the Focus becomes more important in today&#8217;s internet rich world where you are continuously disturbed by notifications, SMS, calls, and emails, etc. You have to decide <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/your-brain-work/200910/easily-distracted-why-its-hard-focus-and-what-do-about-it">what you want to see (focus)</a> [2] not what the software (throwing you all kind of data) is throwing on you. This breaks your continuous attention on a subject/job/reading and you start wasting your time on internet/facebook/google searching unnecessary and unwanted things.</p>
<p>Stay focused start growing&#8230;</p>

<p>Refer the image which was taken from a research paper on Titan [3]  where the presence of an atmosphere, water, lakes, methane, ethane, etc. are detected.</p>
<p>You would be thinking, research papers are fine but what about the data. In addition to the papers, NASA has fulfilled your wish by giving open access to the data that was used in the experiments and research through its data portal [4].</p>
<p>NASA Deputy Administrator Dava Newman said, &#8220;<em>At NASA, we are celebrating this opportunity to extend access to our extensive portfolio of scientific and technical publications&#8221;.</em> &#8220;Through open access and innovation, we invite the global community to join us in exploring Earth, air and space.&#8221;<br />
