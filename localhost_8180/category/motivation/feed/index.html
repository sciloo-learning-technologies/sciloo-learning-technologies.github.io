<p><g class="gr_ gr_19 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="19" data-gr-id="19">Inspiration</g> for this article &#8211;  <strong>Roberta B. Ness (worked on Ovarian Cancer)</strong></p>



<p>Even though in today’s world we are more eager to invent and do more but innovation in healthcare and many other sectors like water treatment, garbage cleaning etc. is very slow for example there is no cheap cancer treatment, <g class="gr_ gr_105 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="105" data-gr-id="105">cost-effectiveness</g> of other medical treatments, etc.<br></p>



<p>Frames define our thinking, the kind of expectations in a particular situation. Frames are cognitive and emotions expectations and can also result in reactions. For example &#8211; you are expecting a hello from a person meeting you the first time, instead, he tells you who are you?</p>



<p>This breaks the flow or assumptions in your thinking.</p>



<p><strong>Frame</strong></p>



<p style="text-align:left">To innovate &#8211; we must break frames. Scientists used to assume that bacteria can’t grow in acidic environment of the stomach, break this assumptions and check the data to explain anomalies.</p>



<p><strong>Observation</strong></p>



<p>To be an innovator &#8211; you must be a great observer.</p>



<p><strong>Flipping the view</strong></p>



<p>God creates every creature to perfection, Darwin flipped it and said it is not <g class="gr_ gr_29 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling" id="29" data-gr-id="29">perfection</g> and <g class="gr_ gr_40 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="40" data-gr-id="40">lets</g> find the reason for it. </p>



<p>Darwin imagined himself as plant to understand the evolution.</p>



<p><strong>Analogy</strong></p>



<p>What is the cause, cells that are around ovarian are same as in breathing pipe (airway<g class="gr_ gr_10 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation multiReplace" id="10" data-gr-id="10">).</g> Is there can be <g class="gr_ gr_31 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="31" data-gr-id="31">reason</g> that smoking can also affect ovary like our airways.</p>



<p><strong>Élie Metchnikoff </strong>&#8211; the discovery of white blood cell (tried suicide 2 times, believed in Darwin theory). He did put a thorn in a fish and found white blood cells around it to protect from the attack. Read about this great scientist to know of his thinking approach.<br></p>



<p><strong>Be bold not cautious. </strong></p>



<p>World need innovation rather than invention for the sake of patent filing. We need to improve the world and solve problems rather than settle in life.<br></p>

<p>When you come to this article, it shows that you really want to understand what goes inside a business and how you can make it successful.</p>



<p>Business is not just about generating cash, earning, revenues, etc. Business is more about Customer first because any business <g class="gr_ gr_21 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="21" data-gr-id="21">generate</g> cash from customers. If customers <g class="gr_ gr_20 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="20" data-gr-id="20">doesn&#8217;t</g> trust your idea/products then your business days are in number. You should keep this trust alive for the whole life of your product. <g class="gr_ gr_185 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="185" data-gr-id="185">Customer</g> should understand what is buying and what is its reliability.</p>



<p>Approaches to a business</p>



<ol><li>Selling&nbsp;</li><li>Customer first</li></ol>



<p>When it is about just selling, you will ignore ethics, customer pain points and ultimately you will sell the products to many people. Nearly all of these customers today or tomorrow will realize the game played with them and then they will give factual details of what happened to others and then it spread like a fire. All your hard work and&nbsp;credibility can be at risk. When credibility is lost, it is really difficult to bring back because it is lost by behaviour which is difficult to correct. Recovery can be a painful and can be a&nbsp; lengthy process.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/05/27/00/58/trust-1418901__340.jpg" alt="" width="232" height="174"/></figure>



<p>When you keep customer first, then you are building trust with customer. You get a return of value (cash or trade) for your products. If customer feels this trust is broken it should be resolved to the customer satisfaction.&nbsp;As a business, you should not exist if you don&#8217;t exchange value. If you don&#8217;t return the value to the customer (product + mental satisfaction or trust) then it is better to not to do a business.</p>



<p>We follow the&nbsp;customer first approach at <g class="gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="4" data-gr-id="4">Sciloo</g> Learning Technologies. It looks simple in words but difficult to follow. You should be ready to incur financial loss in the few cases the and understand that is part of the learning and founding stone of a successful business.</p>



<p>In coming days, more articles will follow on different business aspects. We will target to solve a business&#8217;s problem and then explain the article rather than isolated concepts like marketing or selling etc.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of us know that Edison holds around 1084 patent but do you know he doesn&#8217;t have the highest number of patents. The highest number of patents at the time of this writings are 5183, almost 5 times than Edison&#8217;s. In this article, I will summarize my learnings from one of such inventors &#8211; Mark Johnson [2] (holds more than 500 patents, but not on the list).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-953 size-full" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/patents.jpg" alt="" width="689" height="457" /></p>
<p>From here on, the article will present as if Mark Johnson is talking to you directly.</p>
<h3>Start</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t learn to be an inventor, I was interested in s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">olving problem, got the first assignment with the deadline of 3 months. I worked for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 months on vibration reduction from the magnetic tape in tape recorder and player. After that, I worked on f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">errite core transformer (having small size but high frequencies) for ~4 years.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nobel prize years</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was working on the similar technologies ( Giant magnetoresistance [3] ) for which- Nobel prize was awarded, this invention had applications in the video recorder, hard disk, etc. and ultimately used to shrink the size of these devices and many more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was important because it is highly sensitive (low magnetic force high resistance change) and gives easy detection.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moores law &#8211; increase in no of inventions per year by Mark</span></h3>
<p>I initially worked on materials and then my organization thought I should focus on display now as we were focussing on TV display or general purpose display in Philips. When we started working on display we got the following.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lcd &#8211; 20 patent</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oled &#8211; 40 patent</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">e-ink &#8211; 100 patents</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Still, we were not leaders in display technologies.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were working on the Flat panel, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low power reflective display and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inventors were leading the planning and executions of these project rather than project management guys. My c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">olleague invented 3 out of 10 display technologies in the market but those were not where we could earn the money for the business. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in AMOLED technology, we were the 2nd company to work out the technology and build the first working model.</span></p>
<p>During these years, I noticed that I was filing patents double than the previous year just like CPU power is doubled every year.</p>
<h3>Paper-like display</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were the first on paper like display &#8211; building the prototype and developing a working technology. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon was taking e-ink display from a company which was using license of this Philips technology (there were 100s of patents) from Philips.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big challenge </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then we needed to come up with next big challenges and after utilizing the experience and literature we came to following topics where work could be done.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neuroscience </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emotions</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reconnaissance</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We needed to work on high-risk high reward ideas but the first step was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hypothesis testing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; fail hypothesis fastest. We picked later different ideas ranging from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food, hair to teeth whitening which was very successful.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Process of inventions</span></h3>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">First scope</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, the idea to implement or patent</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Problems &#8211; how to solve them</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior art &#8211; value of the tech, competitors</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">determine the approach </span>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    No art &#8211; direct patent</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    Some &#8211; workaround</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    Much art  avoid or circumvention (use TRIZ technique)</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find a specific problem that valuable control points</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about 5 to 10 years in future</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evaluate on feasibility, novelty, desirability</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The format of a patent</span></h3>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspiration</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short description</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illustration of invention</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Main tech feature</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Main prior art</span></li>
</ol>
<h3>Advice</h3>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work out of your comfort zone</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">No need to be expert, just do your work</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Material patents are most valuable</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spread out across teams and projects to best spread the process (instead of passive communication or emails)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inexperienced team can be productive with the well laid out process</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be the first to spot and get problems &#8211; snatch opportunities</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listening to the experience of 20-30 years is better than one or two sessions on current technology.</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Build on &#8211; expose the world to them</h4>
<p>Find out what your child actually knows and understands, rather than assuming. Asking them good questions would expose many misconceptions and misunderstandings about the world to them. Imagine with little older kids, if we&#8217;re talking about the earth rotation, its orbit, our solar system, they can tell us what is earth and other planets. But can they tell what causes an eclipse? Make better questioning part of life by asking open-ended questions that give us evidence about what and how does this kid understand or not understand.</p>
<h4>Make base strong &#8211; don&#8217;t feed them</h4>
<p>They might tell that the sun is moving around the earth and not the other way which is wrong but hold on. Also ask, why is it night in India when it&#8217;s day in the USA. You&#8217;ll expose them to some very basic scientific fundamentals that you can build on. Kids can come up with totally weird answers and we tend to correct them with the right answers. Rather we should ask them where did they get the answer from, how did they think about it? If you keep feeding them right answers you might never know what is wrong in their thinking process and how they arrive at a particular answer.</p>
<h4>Big picture and Feedback</h4>
<p>As parents, we should show them the bigger picture to make them understand what&#8217;s going on here. It is a very critical piece in their life and growth as they might not connect with the bigger picture when they are doing something. It can affect their interest and motivation.</p>
<p>Another very important area where the parents must be involved all the time is feedback. What kind of feedback do you give? Most of the time it empty and useless feedback. Feedback should be very specific and task focussed and should produce a set of corrective actions.</p>
<p>See the sports coaches, they diagnose whatever the particular sportsperson is doing well and not doing well and then focuses in on the things they need to improve. The importance of the big picture and growth in a skill are very critical aspects of feedback.</p>
<p>Help kids in know what are they doing, why are they doing and how they can make sense of it. It&#8217;s kind of chess board game, If you know the rules of the game, if you can spot the patterns, you&#8217;ve got a much more powerful memory than if all you&#8217;re trying to remember a few pieces and games that you already played.</p>
<h4>Imagination</h4>
<p>Help them imagine what will it be like if they are successful (doing something they love and want to do)? Many successful people imagine themselves doing things and dreaming about achieving the goals and the life they want to have, coach the kids with this principle &#8211; imagining, believing, working and achieving.</p>
<h4>Ability or disability induction</h4>
<p>Don&#8217;t focus on the word or rather forget the word &#8211; ability, rather work with kind of apprenticeship model, where you talk about somebody being naive, novice, apprentice, expert, master as they learn, do, and progress.</p>
<p>Life is a learning process, it is about the work itself not about the kid. Ability is all about reputations, labels, and that really interferes with how teachers and schools treat kids. The biggest difference between a good teacher and a normal teacher is the level of the cognitive demand of the work they set their kids, all the kids.</p>
<p>Expert/good teachers expect more from all of their kids, not just the bright ones. They expect them to do deep learning work which is understanding themselves, making sense of it for themselves. So stay away from the word ability and demand more of our children, all the children.</p>
<p>If you’re told that you are high ability or low ability, It doesn’t take you far for certainly. But If you are told that you can do something well or you can do something better, it gives you a lot of possibilities and opportunities.</p>
<p>By putting kids into ability groups is very harmful, kids at the top get the more imaginative, better, more creative and kids at the bottom are treated as they&#8217;re not going to do well. Kids at the bottom are event told that you are less capable and not in the same league. The gap widens with time and distorts the thinking process and confidence of kids. It is like we are writing a script for them at that point about what they can and can&#8217;t do without really testing it out, without really giving them opportunities, without understanding them.</p>
<p>Kids (ours and others) are like flowers and nature, each has its own beauty and variations, we should nurture it rather than segregating them and damaging them to the core.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5>Forceful learning</h5>
<p>kids know better how they learn rather than somebody teaching/telling them how to learn. Teachers should create an environment for allowing kids to discuss how they learn better and talk openly. But this is not the case in most of the institutions as most of the focus is on forcefully broadcasting textbooks via mouth and not creating a conducive and collaborative environment. The possible reasons can be, it takes more time and energy and it can impact revenue per kid or they have never thought of it.</p>
<p>This clearly shows one signal that particular school or institution either doing it intentionally or unintentionally. If it is intentional then future of kids are in risky hands and if it is unintentional then again the future of kids are in risky hands as the people in charge don&#8217;t do research about learning and don&#8217;t learn themselves.</p>
<p>Kids are very delicate, a proper environment should be provided to them to nurture with freedom as well as discipline. They should feel free to talk openly and not scared of the teachers. I have seen kids including at my home, they are so afraid of teacher and think that they will only do work as given by the teacher and not other work as we are not teachers.</p>
<p>There is a general principle of active learning (<a href="http://weatherhead.case.edu/executive-education/instructors/david-kolb">David Kolb</a>) given below.</p>
<pre><strong>(do -&gt; review -&gt; learn -&gt; apply )</strong>

<strong>+ with many reflection cycles (for understanding how did you tackle the task and what learning you can take to do it better next time)</strong></pre>
<p>There are few misconceptions about what makes a better learner, let&#8217;s discuss them in the section below.</p>
<h5>The misconceptions about better learner</h5>
<p>It is very hard to formulate that study harder makes a better learner. We don&#8217;t fully understand peoples&#8217; different backgrounds, family culture as well as their social networking and these all things also affect the learning goals and reach. Take the example of Einstein who was kicked out of school and failed many exams but this didn&#8217;t affect his learning and output.</p>
<p>So we can say that a good learner is a person who&#8217;s always open to learning, networking, taking risks. We need to read research about learning to understand better what is going on the field and what are the latest findings on learning. This will help us in imbibing those learning in our learning approach and it may add value to the existing methodologies that we are following.</p>
<h5>Approach</h5>
<p>We need to learn on our own and then discuss the learning in a group, it can be in person or on a social platform like online forums, Whatsapp, Facebook, etc. Learning is impactful if it is done in groups that are collaborating and interacting with each other frequently. Along with learning, collaboration builds social skills which in-turn make learning more enjoyable and strong with top notch output.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learning can be divided into 4 parts and greatly depends on the learner&#8217;s purpose.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5><strong>Learning to know</strong></h5>
<p>Reading, enquiry, etc.</li>
<li>
<h5><strong>Learning to do</strong></h5>
<p>Building a model, tool, etc.</li>
<li>
<h5><strong>Learning to live in society</strong></h5>
<p>Studying the life and behaviour of life and society to live</li>
<li>
<h5><strong>Learning to be self-aware</strong></h5>
<p>Awareness of our mind, body, etc. to live a happy and healthy life</li>
</ol>
<p>Being scared or more disciplined may hinder the learning process and critical thinking for us and especially kids as they are learning the world around them. Kids should be provided with a comfortable and approachable environment where they should be free to use diverse methods for thinking and collaborating.</p>
<h4>Traditional classroom</h4>
<p>Traditionally classroom teaching or learning is more focussed on maintaining silence where kids are told not to speak and interact loudly to each other. This environment hampers their brain development in the long run. Kids are even scolded and given punishment for speaking differently than teachers. You would remember the scene (linked below) from PK movie that signifies that this even prevails in universities.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="What is a machine? - Funny scene | 3 Idiots | Aamir Khan | R Madhavan | Sharman Joshi" width="750" height="422" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-MlkASchodc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Traditional classrooms or even today&#8217;s classrooms have teachers to<a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.ENRL.TC.ZS"> students ratio ~1:30 or more</a> and this means personalised learning is not inherently possible as a teacher have too many students to reach and teach. This result in a coercive method (mostly one way from teacher to students) which is harmful to learning.</p>
<h4>Authority versus Authoritarian</h4>
<p>Teachers become authoritarian (running their own rules, forceful way of teaching, punishment, etc.) instead of authority on the subjects (expert in their fields). This way of working is not healthy for open thinking and discussions. Kids are scared to even to speak simple things and their growth becomes stagnant.</p>
<h4>New model &#8211; Progressive</h4>
<p>There is a need for the new model called progressive, personalised,  or constructive teaching. These paradigms focus that kids make meaning and understand things by experiencing themselves. They make sense of their surroundings and world, the teacher can act as a catalyst to spark the excitement and curiosity. This spark is the most important impression that will be with them all their life and guide their thought process and actions.</p>
<p>Please share your thoughts in the comment section or by reaching to us. We are planning to start a revolution in the way kids are taught and they learn. Keep an eye for the announcement in coming months from us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stargazing is the best part of our workshop. Kids were invited along with parents to share their joy and aha moments.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their excitement and rain of questions and discussions about the earth, the sun, and the universe gave us the happiness we always look for &#8211; the pleasure of finding things out and observing.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Life &#8211; bag of happiness and sadness</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">life is filled with lots of surprises. It takes you to the top and brings down many times and you feel </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">both happy and sad. Nothing is permanent as we are Human. Our mood changes, our environment changes and it impacts us in positive and negative ways both.</span></p>
<h4>Feeling no ambition and value</h4>
<p>This story will tell your value to you in Life. <span style="font-weight: 400;">When things are tough and life seems to be difficult, it is easy to lose ambitions, to lose self-esteem, courage, love. You are broken, but is it really so? Ask yourself. Are you broken or you are confused about yourself.</span></p>
<h4>Story of Value &#8211; you are winner until you loose</h4>
<p>In a small distant town, there was a seminar going on where a huge number of people were gathered. It was not a formal seminar but a kind of social gathering and discussion. The gentleman on the stage start waving a 1000 Rs note and started asking the public who wants it. Not a surprise, nearly everybody wanted that note as it was coming free with no strings attached.</p>
<p>Then the person crumbled the note in his hands and again asked the same question &#8211; Who wants it now? Again, everybody raised their hands and public were about to push each other, everybody thinking they will get it.</p>
<p>Then to the surprise of all, the person took the notes and put it underneath his shoes and crushed it badly in dust. It became soiled and crumbled when he showed it to all. Here he comes again, Who wants it now? This time though not everybody but many people still wanted that note.</p>
<p>The person in charge of the note broke into a big laughter and then became sad with a slow body movement. He started speaking, you have seen today the value of this note, but I wanted to tell you something else with this story. I want to show your value to you all.</p>
<p>You and me are like this note, broken and stressed by Life many times over and over. You think that nobody wants you and you slowly get into depression thinking that you are worthless.</p>
<p>Still, there are people in your life who always want you and see value in you every time. They understand you are down but strong, they are always there for you.  Your value as a person like the note is still intact but it is our perception and comparison to the life of others that make us feel low and weak. Failures are temporary setbacks rather they are hidden big learning opportunities.</p>
<h4>Be a man of action &#8211; create your own destiny &#8211; write your own rules &#8211; success principles &#8211; Be the author of your life story</h4>
<p>Every person is valuable and has special strengths that it may have never focussed upon. You may not have stopped to break from a cycle of life that is continuous and deadly if you get into it. You need to bring all your focus into your ambitions and dreams to realise your true value. Be a child again. Live with this philosophy forever &#8211; I am fearless and a winner. You should have big dreams and ambition that drives you for the Life.  They can be any like starting a job, startup, social work, spending life with family. There is not a single straight line or defined path that we should all follow. We should follow our own hearts and create our own paths. Write your own destiny. Are you afraid of losing a job or becoming unstable &#8211; any way you are loosing life and your health that should have been more important?</p>
<p>Spend time with yourself, start feeling yourself, do hard work, be fearless &#8211; you will realise what you are capable of doing. Keep doing/flowing because actions generate value otherwise nobody like still stinky water.</p>
<p>Please share your life stories and experience in the comments section below or send us an email. We will share them on our platform for our readers to take learnings from your struggles and growth.</p>

<p>Check the famous personalities below if you are still down. Never say die and never give up.</p>
<p class="hed"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King">Stephen King</a> <img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-493 size-thumbnail" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/skic-cover-front-small-150x150.jpg" alt="stephen king" width="150" height="150" />&#8220;We are not interested in science fiction which deals with negative utopias. They do not sell.&#8221; Those were the words of one publisher who passed over the manuscript for &#8220;Carrie,&#8221; which King submitted when he was 20 years old. &#8220;Carrie&#8221; (iconic thriller) was rejected by 30 publishers, causing King to give up on it and throw it in the trash. His wife convinced Stephen to rework on it. The rest is history as you can search on google about this novel.</p>
<p class="hed">King has since published more than 50 books, all worldwide bestsellers and immensely successful. He was down but stood up and believed in his value.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-492 size-medium" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/list-disney-mickey-89856234-E-300x168.jpeg" alt="walt disney" width="300" height="168" /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney">Walt Disney</a> Walt Disney was fired from a newspaper for &#8220;not being creative enough.&#8221; One of his early ventures, called Laugh-o-gram Studios, went bankrupt after. The creator of Mickey and Minnie Mouse went on to be nominated for 59 Academy Awards, winning 32, all for his unparalleled animations.</p>
<p>He still holds the record for the most Oscars won by an individual. He knew his value and didn&#8217;t rely on someone else recognition for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-494 size-medium" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rs_1024x759-160126165827-1024.Oprah-Winfrey.ms_.012616-300x222.jpg" alt="oprah winfrey" width="300" height="222" /></p>
<p class="hed"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a> &#8216;The Oprah Winfrey Show&#8217; became one of the highest ranking shows in American history. Oprah&#8217;s was thrown out of the job being told that she was too emotional and not fit for television. Oprah was one of the best-paid females in the entertainment industry and remains the richest self-made woman and only black female billionaire.</p>
<p class="hed">He didn&#8217;t go down but kept fighting like the 1000 Rs note in the story above to retain its value and becoming successful.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a long and tiring career, an elderly carpenter was getting ready to retire. He told his head of his plans to leave the construction job and live a more peaceful life with his wife and the extended family. He said, I will miss the money, but I need to retire as I am tired of doing the same job daily and want to break out of it. The head was sad to see this good worker go and asked if he could build just one last house as a personal favour.</p>
<p>The carpenter said I will do it, but in time it was easy to see that his heart was not in his work. He started doing shoddy workmanship and used inferior materials. It was an unfortunate way to end a dedicated career. It also showed he was in haste and it affected his work.</p>
<p>When the carpenter finished his work, the head came to check the house. He handed the house keys to the carpenter. “This is your house,” he said, “my gift to you for all the hard work you did for me all the years along.”</p>
<p>The carpenter was shocked and sad! If he could have known early he was building his own house, he could have done it differently and nicely.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-473 size-medium" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mourning-77382_1280-300x169.jpg" alt="sad and thinking" width="300" height="169" /></p>
<p><strong>So it is with us. We build our lives, a day at a time, often putting less than our best into the building</strong>. Then with a shock, we realise we have to live in the house we have built. If we could do it again, we’d do it much differently. But we cannot go back.</p>
<p>You are the carpenter. Each day you hammer a nail, place a board, or erect a wall. Life is a do-it-yourself  &#8211; project. <strong>Your attitudes and the choices you make today will build the &#8220;house&#8221; you live in tomorrow. So better build it wisely!</strong></p>
<p>Put thought into your actions and choices/decisions as they will affect your outcomes. It doesn&#8217;t mean that you don&#8217;t live on your terms but you keep yourself aware of that your life is made of your decisions. The decisions you are taking now are as per the life you want to see not in the haste.</p>
<p>All the best, have a happy and successful life. Please share your views and real life examples in the comments section.</p>
