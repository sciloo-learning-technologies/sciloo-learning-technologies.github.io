<h3>A microservice is an architectural style with small services which are</h3>



<ol><li>isolated, </li><li>loosely-coupled </li><li>works on a single concern.</li><li>Own their own data</li><li>Lightweight communication usually with HTTP Restful API</li><li>Built around business capabilities/domain, example below </li></ol>



<p> DDD (<g class="gr_ gr_13 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="13" data-gr-id="13">Domain driven</g> design) is the way to go while <g class="gr_ gr_25 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="25" data-gr-id="25">designig</g> microservices.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://lh5.googleusercontent.com/OlYKfFDflU8_Pjv-ppbq6CtTeV8-J7O-a6PKceZJSLQWaVU4x30Kf63oKlwyaxHonk01lwI5dR8yqSSZvHd8py7PPTlhhoQGTtP94oPNIEOzeCHnB8LSxuSZcqG2sm-OCgVmWZw-" alt=""/></figure>



<ol><li>Independently deployable by automated means</li><li>Right tech for right problem &#8211; each microservice can be implemented on its own tech</li></ol>



<p>Advantages</p>



<ol><li>Language independent as conform to HTTP Restful</li><li>Individual team for each microservice</li><li>Scalable</li><li>Fault tolerance</li><li>Container friendly (docker, kubernete)</li><li>Fast iteration for adding code</li><li>small development teams, </li><li>shorter development cycles</li><li>flexibility in language selection</li><li>enhanced service scalability</li></ol>



<p>Disadvantages</p>



<ol><li>Complex interactions &#8211; System + Operational</li><li>Overhead of communication across databases and servers</li><li>Resource and nw overhead</li><li>Complex authentication and authorization scheme in the Microservices </li></ol>



<p>Design Considerations</p>



<ul><li><strong>Cross-cutting</strong>: microservices need not deal with details regarding problems outside their specific scope.</li><li><strong>Data sharing</strong> is hard. Microservices tend to favor per-service or per-group databases that can be updated directly. </li><li><strong>Availability</strong>: Microservices, by virtue of being isolated and independent, need to be monitored to detect failures.</li><li><strong>Evolution</strong>: Microservices tend to evolve fast. Old versions are usually available as long as there are clients who need to consume data from them. Newer versions are exposed in an application-specific way. For instance, with an HTTP/REST API, the version of the microservice may be part of a custom header, or be embedded in the returned data. Account for this.</li><li><strong>Automated deployment</strong>: The whole reason that microservices are so convenient nowadays is that it is so easy to deploy a new service from a completely clean environment. </li><li><strong>Interdependencies</strong>: Keep them to a minimum. </li><li><strong>Transport and data format</strong>: Microservices are fit for any transport and data format; however, they are usually exposed publicly through a RESTful API over HTTP. Any data format fit for your information works. HTTP + JSON is very popular these days, but there is nothing stopping you from using protocol-buffers over AMQP, for instance.</li></ul>



<p>microservices are developed almost in isolation. <strong>Cross-cutting concerns </strong>are dealt with by <strong>upper layers</strong> in the software stack

<p>Controlled experiments are building block for decision making&nbsp;</p>



<p>How useful is this feature&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is it moving towards my and company goal&nbsp;</p>



<p>How team is performing&nbsp;</p>



<p>Characteristics about experimentation at Airbnb – different in different companies&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Data Portal</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Airbnb has a data portal for all the data related work different teams/individual have done. They use the similar tech to google page rank,&nbsp;its&nbsp;kind of search engine.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image-13-1024x512.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1078" width="568" height="284"/></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ML not equal to data + black box&nbsp;</p>



<p>ML = data + assumptions&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Free Lunch Theorem</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>As per free lunch theorem, without assumptions we can’t build anything.&nbsp;We can’t have one generic&nbsp;<g class="gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="4" data-gr-id="4">algo</g>&nbsp;that is applicable for all the problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have&nbsp;<strong>constraints&nbsp;</strong>like&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp; assumptions,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp; prior knowledge,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp; domain knowledge&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;when dealing with problems and without considering these how we can solve a problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Data + prior knowledge</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Detection of a person in frame&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a simple approach, we will need many images with person at different location.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But with this knowledge, we can develop transformations to shift a person in the image and then train the model on these images instead of acquiring those images.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We tend to think about Big data that we can develop weak models and can forget the constraints/assumptions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are 2 types of sizes&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp; 1. computation size&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp; 2. statistical size&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1060" width="243" height="198"/></figure></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1061" width="236" height="195"/></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Computationally small but statistical big&nbsp;</p>



<p>Without assumptions, how we can predict a current value for a new voltage value?&nbsp; On the right side, we can take into consideration about V = IR and can be confident that the line is good predictor for future voltage values. This dataset is small in computational size but big in statistical size.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1063" width="384" height="261"/></figure>



<p>Statistically small but computationally big&nbsp;</p>



<p>The above data is computationally big, take a simple example of a <g class="gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="5" data-gr-id="5">black</g> and white image of 10X10 pixel, all the combinations can yield combinations that might be more than the total number of atoms in the universe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unless we make assumptions, it is very difficult to do computation with these big set of images. This above images data can be computationally very large but statistically very small.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Model based ML</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of getting lost in the sea of algorithms/models/research papers, we should use model-based learning to use data and assumptions to derive ML algorithm.&nbsp;We should work mainly on defining our assumptions about the problem very clearly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Machine learning and the learning machine with Dr. Christopher Bishop" width="750" height="422" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9W2BcQyT0ZM?start=695&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Translate your assumptions into a model and that is the core of model-based learning. If our assumptions are sound/strong then we get much more information from the same amount of data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Can we develop a tool to do it automatically? Can this dream be true?&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1064" width="288" height="235"/></figure>



<p><strong>User &amp; Movies</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Predict the question marks – whether a user like or dislike&nbsp;those movie&nbsp;for which he has not given&nbsp;a&nbsp;answer. 10ks of movies, 10Ms of users.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1062" width="433" height="331"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image-5-1024x507.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1065" width="618" height="306"/></figure>



<p>Based on my like or dislike, ML is suggesting movies closer to green area that I can like for sure and closer to red area for movies that I may not like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is learning my behavior and suggesting me titles based on the populations&nbsp;similar to&nbsp;me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Information (as per information theory by&nbsp;Shanon) is the surprise from data. Just like above movie ML&nbsp;algo&nbsp;suggest me movies closer to green area and I pick then there is a very less surprise in the data and suggestions don’t move big.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But instead of liking the movie, if I dislike it, it is a big surprise for the&nbsp;algo&nbsp;and movies suggestions move big.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Quantifying uncertainty</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Uncertainty is an essential part of machine learning and it is a modern view of ML.&nbsp;<strong>Bayes theorem</strong>&nbsp;is at the core of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>BT: P(A/B) = [P(A) * P(B/A)]/P(B)&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Bishop view on Healthcare</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Machine learning and the learning machine with Dr. Christopher Bishop" width="750" height="422" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9W2BcQyT0ZM?start=695&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>It is one of the biggest opportunities but complex also. Personalized healthcare can be a phenomenon suggesting you personalized course of treatment because as an individual each one of us is unique. It is like machine can learn our movies preferences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;This can happen by analyzing the info from other millions of people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp; Cloud based tech + ML tech + Domain experts (from Hospitals like clinicians, doctors, radiologists, etc.)&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Trust and privacy in the Data</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data is encrypted so it is only accessible to those who have keys but It can become vulnerable while being processed. So Microsoft has taken care of processing data in <g class="gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="7" data-gr-id="7">secure</g> vault kind of infrastructure where data can be <g class="gr_ gr_10 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling" id="10" data-gr-id="10">access</g> only to people who have keys. It is secure by hardware and software. </p>



<p><strong>Factor Graph</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image-18.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1120"/></figure>



<p>The probability of getting a circular or triangular cookie depends upon which jar we choose. Round circles on the right sides are &#8211; one random variable for Jar, one random variable for Cookie</p>



<p>These random variables are driven by their respective probability distribution functions (PDFs) denoted as shaded squares.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of us know that Edison holds around 1084 patent but do you know he doesn&#8217;t have the highest number of patents. The highest number of patents at the time of this writings are 5183, almost 5 times than Edison&#8217;s. In this article, I will summarize my learnings from one of such inventors &#8211; Mark Johnson [2] (holds more than 500 patents, but not on the list).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-953 size-full" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/patents.jpg" alt="" width="689" height="457" /></p>
<p>From here on, the article will present as if Mark Johnson is talking to you directly.</p>
<h3>Start</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t learn to be an inventor, I was interested in s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">olving problem, got the first assignment with the deadline of 3 months. I worked for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 months on vibration reduction from the magnetic tape in tape recorder and player. After that, I worked on f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">errite core transformer (having small size but high frequencies) for ~4 years.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nobel prize years</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was working on the similar technologies ( Giant magnetoresistance [3] ) for which- Nobel prize was awarded, this invention had applications in the video recorder, hard disk, etc. and ultimately used to shrink the size of these devices and many more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was important because it is highly sensitive (low magnetic force high resistance change) and gives easy detection.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moores law &#8211; increase in no of inventions per year by Mark</span></h3>
<p>I initially worked on materials and then my organization thought I should focus on display now as we were focussing on TV display or general purpose display in Philips. When we started working on display we got the following.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lcd &#8211; 20 patent</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oled &#8211; 40 patent</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">e-ink &#8211; 100 patents</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Still, we were not leaders in display technologies.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were working on the Flat panel, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low power reflective display and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inventors were leading the planning and executions of these project rather than project management guys. My c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">olleague invented 3 out of 10 display technologies in the market but those were not where we could earn the money for the business. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in AMOLED technology, we were the 2nd company to work out the technology and build the first working model.</span></p>
<p>During these years, I noticed that I was filing patents double than the previous year just like CPU power is doubled every year.</p>
<h3>Paper-like display</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were the first on paper like display &#8211; building the prototype and developing a working technology. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon was taking e-ink display from a company which was using license of this Philips technology (there were 100s of patents) from Philips.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big challenge </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then we needed to come up with next big challenges and after utilizing the experience and literature we came to following topics where work could be done.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neuroscience </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emotions</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reconnaissance</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We needed to work on high-risk high reward ideas but the first step was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hypothesis testing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; fail hypothesis fastest. We picked later different ideas ranging from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food, hair to teeth whitening which was very successful.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Process of inventions</span></h3>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">First scope</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, the idea to implement or patent</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Problems &#8211; how to solve them</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior art &#8211; value of the tech, competitors</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">determine the approach </span>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    No art &#8211; direct patent</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    Some &#8211; workaround</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    Much art  avoid or circumvention (use TRIZ technique)</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find a specific problem that valuable control points</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about 5 to 10 years in future</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evaluate on feasibility, novelty, desirability</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The format of a patent</span></h3>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspiration</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short description</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illustration of invention</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Main tech feature</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Main prior art</span></li>
</ol>
<h3>Advice</h3>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work out of your comfort zone</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">No need to be expert, just do your work</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Material patents are most valuable</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spread out across teams and projects to best spread the process (instead of passive communication or emails)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inexperienced team can be productive with the well laid out process</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be the first to spot and get problems &#8211; snatch opportunities</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listening to the experience of 20-30 years is better than one or two sessions on current technology.</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When learning about how to use a telescope and how to make one yourself, we came across a very good site [1] maintained by Will Kalif and were impressed by the content on the website, it is the culmination of years of experience and insights.</p>
<p>Later we got to know that Mr Will Kalif has also published a book on telescopes titled &#8220;See It with a Small Telescope: 101 Cosmic Wonders&#8221; and we thought to give it a try for our ventures into the night sky and for our readers. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Will received his first telescope as a Christmas present and motivated many people since then after feeling the joy of watching heavens himself.</span></p>
<p>After reading the book, the first thing come to mind is &#8211; to the point and clear. This book is written primarily for novice and amateurs, it introduces the concept at the basic level and expands it if it is required. Author motivates the amateurs not to give up, start small, and keep trying until it works.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book talks richness of the night sky f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rom the moon, to 60 million years far spiral galaxy, to cluster &#8211; like Galileo found them. The sky is not just filled with only s</span>tars but there are different objects galaxies, nebulae, planets, etc.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-935 size-large" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180528_003025_cp-1024x479.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="374" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will points that don’t compare your telescope experience with the Hubble but enjoy the pleasure of observing things yourself and appreciating it. Readers are</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> encouraged to read in sequence but you can skip to the chapter of interest based on your experience.</span></p>
<p>It is very important to set up your telescope in advance to let its optics adjust to the temperature and humidity, yes it adjusts. Most of the pictures used in the books are captured by small telescopes like 6” or less.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The book b</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rings clarity to the thoughts and the process of observation in a step by step manner. No extra fillers are used, the author talks directly to the point in a logical manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to know and use star charts and catalogues like Messier and NGC (New General Catalog) along with the details </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of magnitude and international convention of celestial coordinates with best viewing months, this book covers that too. You can start with e</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">asy to find objects like the moon, Jupiter, Saturn, M 13 globular, Andromeda and Orion nebula and then expand into deep sky objects slowly as they are covered in their own chapter.</span></p>
<p>The book is divided into 11 chapters with first 3 chapters are dedicated to the basics ranging from telescopes to astrophotography to our galaxy milky way.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-937 size-full" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/toc.jpg" alt="" width="594" height="650" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telescopes parts, filters, mounting and viewing technique are covered in basic details. Important researched items are also included like using the side of the eye than the centre (averted vision) along with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">common Q&amp;A like why and what to do when a telescope is having vibration, an object is in upside down position?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Piggybacking, afocal, prime focus, eyepiece projection photography techniques are also introduced to the readers in the book.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-931 size-large" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180527_152307_cp-1024x498.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="389" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Navigating the night sky by l</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ocating the cloudy band of the milky way, spotting Ursa (major and minor), Cassiopeia, Cygnus are covered in each separate chapters. The concept of e</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cliptic path containing all the planets and sun, the moon is very important one and the author has highlighted it on several occasions. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-933 size-large" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180528_003121_cp-1024x436.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="341" /></p>
<p>Overall the whole book is an interesting read and must be part of every beginner&#8217;s collection. Will has managed to bring in many years of his passion into a well defined and to the point content that readers will enjoy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever wondered why don&#8217;t we see stars and planets in the daytime on earth? One day, a curious kid was asking question after seeing Jupiter in the early hours that where this Jupiter is gone now, why we can&#8217;t see it. I was enthralled and at the same time happy to see such curiosity. This is what differentiate us from animals.<br />
Then I thought, is this question valid in space particularly if we are standing on the moon? It becomes more interesting when moon come into the picture. So this question can be divided into two parts.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why we can&#8217;t see stars in daytime on earth?</li>
<li>Is this phenomenon only observable on earth, what about the moon?</li>
</ol>
<p>Firstly, lets understand the reason of this behaviour on earth. As we know, earth has atmosphere with dust particles and other particles which scatter the sun light all over the earth atmosphere and create a blue colour in the sky which has more brightness than stars in the background. But some time we can see moon in the day time, it is because moon is a very bright object and its brightness is still more than earth&#8217;s blueish sky.</p>
<p>For explaining the question 2, lets imagine if you are standing on the moon. Do you think the same behaviour will apply on moon? We will find shortly if you are right or wrong.</p>
<p>We should notice that Moon doesn&#8217;t have a atmosphere and no particles to scatter light. This results in Sun and stars visible in day time. You can see stars both in day (Figure 1) and night (Figure 2) on the moon. It is really interesting behaviour which is difficult to understand at first but if you understand how light behave, things become easy. We will cover the light/optics in details in coming posts. So, it is the result of light scattering on earth and absence of this process on moon that gives us the answer.</p>

<p>Please comment what do you think of this behaviour and do you know any other place in space which has more strange behaviour than earth and moon.</p>

<p>The interesting point is if the ball is light and you push it away or sideways it doesn&#8217;t fall but wobbles in a complex path. This is difficult to believe. Kids will love it and you will be busy finding the answer.</p>

<p>We will be posting videos with different round objects later after experimenting with them. We will also try to build one airplane to see how it behaves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mosquitoes are crepuscular insects. It means they are the most active during twilight i.e. the period of dawn and dusk.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mosquitoes that consume blood are female.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anopheles mosquitoes enter the house between 5 p.m. and 9.30 p.m. and again in early hours of the morning. They start biting by late evening and the peak of biting activity is at midnight and early hours of the morning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mosquitoes can smell human breath.They have receptors on their antennae that detect the carbon dioxide released when we exhale. Those plumes of CO2 rise into the air, acting as trails that the mosquitoes follow to find the source.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-692 alignnone" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/mosquito-2-300x289.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="289" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, sw</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eat help mosquitoes to choose their victim. Our skin produces more than 340 chemical odours, and some of them smell like dinner to mosquitoes. They are fond of octenol, a chemical released in sweat, as well as cholesterol, folic acid, certain bacteria, skin lotions, and perfume.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of mosquitoes feed around evening and at dawn. The dry heat that often occurs during daylight hours in the summer can quickly kill mosquitoes by causing them to become dehydrated. As such, most mosquitoes rest or sleep in a dark, sheltered place during the daylight hours, preferably an area that is relatively humid, such as tucked inside vegetation like plants and grass. They also can be found sleeping the day away inside man-made structures like culverts or barns, or natural shelters such as caves, holes in the ground, and holes in trees.  They spend their first 10 days in water. The lifespan of a female adult mosquito is 42-56 days and for Male adult, it is 10days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By keeping the windows and doors closed between 5 p.m. and 10 p.m and again in the early morning, one can prevent the entry of these mosquitoes into the house. Also protect yourself against the bites in the evenings and early mornings by wearing garments that cover the body as much as possible and at bedtime, by using mosquito nets without fail.</span></p>
