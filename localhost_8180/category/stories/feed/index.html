										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Life &#8211; bag of happiness and sadness</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">life is filled with lots of surprises. It takes you to the top and brings down many times and you feel </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">both happy and sad. Nothing is permanent as we are Human. Our mood changes, our environment changes and it impacts us in positive and negative ways both.</span></p>
<h4>Feeling no ambition and value</h4>
<p>This story will tell your value to you in Life. <span style="font-weight: 400;">When things are tough and life seems to be difficult, it is easy to lose ambitions, to lose self-esteem, courage, love. You are broken, but is it really so? Ask yourself. Are you broken or you are confused about yourself.</span></p>
<h4>Story of Value &#8211; you are winner until you loose</h4>
<p>In a small distant town, there was a seminar going on where a huge number of people were gathered. It was not a formal seminar but a kind of social gathering and discussion. The gentleman on the stage start waving a 1000 Rs note and started asking the public who wants it. Not a surprise, nearly everybody wanted that note as it was coming free with no strings attached.</p>
<p>Then the person crumbled the note in his hands and again asked the same question &#8211; Who wants it now? Again, everybody raised their hands and public were about to push each other, everybody thinking they will get it.</p>
<p>Then to the surprise of all, the person took the notes and put it underneath his shoes and crushed it badly in dust. It became soiled and crumbled when he showed it to all. Here he comes again, Who wants it now? This time though not everybody but many people still wanted that note.</p>
<p>The person in charge of the note broke into a big laughter and then became sad with a slow body movement. He started speaking, you have seen today the value of this note, but I wanted to tell you something else with this story. I want to show your value to you all.</p>
<p>You and me are like this note, broken and stressed by Life many times over and over. You think that nobody wants you and you slowly get into depression thinking that you are worthless.</p>
<p>Still, there are people in your life who always want you and see value in you every time. They understand you are down but strong, they are always there for you.  Your value as a person like the note is still intact but it is our perception and comparison to the life of others that make us feel low and weak. Failures are temporary setbacks rather they are hidden big learning opportunities.</p>
<h4>Be a man of action &#8211; create your own destiny &#8211; write your own rules &#8211; success principles &#8211; Be the author of your life story</h4>
<p>Every person is valuable and has special strengths that it may have never focussed upon. You may not have stopped to break from a cycle of life that is continuous and deadly if you get into it. You need to bring all your focus into your ambitions and dreams to realise your true value. Be a child again. Live with this philosophy forever &#8211; I am fearless and a winner. You should have big dreams and ambition that drives you for the Life.  They can be any like starting a job, startup, social work, spending life with family. There is not a single straight line or defined path that we should all follow. We should follow our own hearts and create our own paths. Write your own destiny. Are you afraid of losing a job or becoming unstable &#8211; any way you are loosing life and your health that should have been more important?</p>
<p>Spend time with yourself, start feeling yourself, do hard work, be fearless &#8211; you will realise what you are capable of doing. Keep doing/flowing because actions generate value otherwise nobody like still stinky water.</p>
<p>Please share your life stories and experience in the comments section below or send us an email. We will share them on our platform for our readers to take learnings from your struggles and growth.</p>

<p>Check the famous personalities below if you are still down. Never say die and never give up.</p>
<p class="hed"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King">Stephen King</a> <img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-493 size-thumbnail" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/skic-cover-front-small-150x150.jpg" alt="stephen king" width="150" height="150" />&#8220;We are not interested in science fiction which deals with negative utopias. They do not sell.&#8221; Those were the words of one publisher who passed over the manuscript for &#8220;Carrie,&#8221; which King submitted when he was 20 years old. &#8220;Carrie&#8221; (iconic thriller) was rejected by 30 publishers, causing King to give up on it and throw it in the trash. His wife convinced Stephen to rework on it. The rest is history as you can search on google about this novel.</p>
<p class="hed">King has since published more than 50 books, all worldwide bestsellers and immensely successful. He was down but stood up and believed in his value.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-492 size-medium" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/list-disney-mickey-89856234-E-300x168.jpeg" alt="walt disney" width="300" height="168" /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney">Walt Disney</a> Walt Disney was fired from a newspaper for &#8220;not being creative enough.&#8221; One of his early ventures, called Laugh-o-gram Studios, went bankrupt after. The creator of Mickey and Minnie Mouse went on to be nominated for 59 Academy Awards, winning 32, all for his unparalleled animations.</p>
<p>He still holds the record for the most Oscars won by an individual. He knew his value and didn&#8217;t rely on someone else recognition for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-494 size-medium" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rs_1024x759-160126165827-1024.Oprah-Winfrey.ms_.012616-300x222.jpg" alt="oprah winfrey" width="300" height="222" /></p>
<p class="hed"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a> &#8216;The Oprah Winfrey Show&#8217; became one of the highest ranking shows in American history. Oprah&#8217;s was thrown out of the job being told that she was too emotional and not fit for television. Oprah was one of the best-paid females in the entertainment industry and remains the richest self-made woman and only black female billionaire.</p>
<p class="hed">He didn&#8217;t go down but kept fighting like the 1000 Rs note in the story above to retain its value and becoming successful.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a long and tiring career, an elderly carpenter was getting ready to retire. He told his head of his plans to leave the construction job and live a more peaceful life with his wife and the extended family. He said, I will miss the money, but I need to retire as I am tired of doing the same job daily and want to break out of it. The head was sad to see this good worker go and asked if he could build just one last house as a personal favour.</p>
<p>The carpenter said I will do it, but in time it was easy to see that his heart was not in his work. He started doing shoddy workmanship and used inferior materials. It was an unfortunate way to end a dedicated career. It also showed he was in haste and it affected his work.</p>
<p>When the carpenter finished his work, the head came to check the house. He handed the house keys to the carpenter. “This is your house,” he said, “my gift to you for all the hard work you did for me all the years along.”</p>
<p>The carpenter was shocked and sad! If he could have known early he was building his own house, he could have done it differently and nicely.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-473 size-medium" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mourning-77382_1280-300x169.jpg" alt="sad and thinking" width="300" height="169" /></p>
<p><strong>So it is with us. We build our lives, a day at a time, often putting less than our best into the building</strong>. Then with a shock, we realise we have to live in the house we have built. If we could do it again, we’d do it much differently. But we cannot go back.</p>
<p>You are the carpenter. Each day you hammer a nail, place a board, or erect a wall. Life is a do-it-yourself  &#8211; project. <strong>Your attitudes and the choices you make today will build the &#8220;house&#8221; you live in tomorrow. So better build it wisely!</strong></p>
<p>Put thought into your actions and choices/decisions as they will affect your outcomes. It doesn&#8217;t mean that you don&#8217;t live on your terms but you keep yourself aware of that your life is made of your decisions. The decisions you are taking now are as per the life you want to see not in the haste.</p>
<p>All the best, have a happy and successful life. Please share your views and real life examples in the comments section.</p>
