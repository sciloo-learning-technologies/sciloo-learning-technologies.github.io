										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wind is moving air and caused by differences in air pressure within our atmosphere or we can say it is the flow of gases on a large scale. Wind is caused by uneven heating of the atmosphere by the sun, variations in the earth’s surface, and rotation of the earth. Mountains, bodies of water, and vegetation all influence wind flow patterns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wind is also used to generate electricity. For the generation of electricity from wind, we use wind turbines. A wind turbine works the opposite of a fan. Instead of using electricity to make wind, like a fan, wind turbines use wind to make electricity. The wind turns the blades which connect to a generator and makes electricity.</span></p>
<p><b>Experiment in Lab:-</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We performed this experiment in our Lab. For wind energy generator experiment we need one dc motor, one LED, one turbine which we rotate with fan or wind.</span></p>
<p><b>Procedure:-</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make a turbine with either a plastic bottle or with cardboard.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Untitled.png" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is Untitled.png" width="164" height="175" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stick the turbine to a stand. Fix the stand on dc motor with both of motor input current points are connected to the LED.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Untitled1.png" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is Untitled1.png" width="187" height="167" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, place the turbine in front of the electric fan. As the motor blade rotates, it rotates the shaft of the motor which generates electricity and the LED glows. We will post the video of the experiment soon.</span></p>
<p>Basically, we are converting one form on energy to another (wind to electricity). The magnet inside the motor rotates which induces the current in the motor winding using induction and this induced current give electricity to the connected led.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The Core of any Business</h3>
<p>People don&#8217;t make more mistakes in management from wrong answers to right questions but from right answers to wrong questions, yet people generally spend more time finding the answer than identifying the relevant questions.</p>
<h3>3 Pillars of Startup</h3>
<ul>
<li>Expertise</li>
<li>Resources</li>
<li>Aspirations</li>
</ul>
<p>Should we adapt to find the strategy according to the resources or make the strategy and then identify the resources?</p>
<p>In a technical project &#8211; the priority of the founders and team are restricted by the finances as they are generally limited and way below the requirement. Let&#8217;s see on what principles strategy can be prepared.</p>
<h3>Four Fundamentals of Strategy</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Victory</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your goal must be not to be a marginal competitor expecting to hold 1 or 2% of the market share, it is equivalent to making the ambition marginal and also admitting implicitly that your innovation is not so powerful and attractive.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Build on strengths</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Identify the key strengths of your project/innovation, the characteristics that make it competitive and winning. Look for the points of differentiation which will make the difference with competitors. Invest in these key strengths to increase the difference.</p>
<p>Try to identify the weakness that makes you a real handicap against your competitors and invest to eliminate them and ignore the other weaknesses.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Risk estimation</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Any creative project includes risks, so this is not about eliminating them, but comprehend them and minimise them as much as possible. Dimensions below can be taken into consideration for this.</p>
<p>How reliable can changes in the environment be predicted?</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the degree of technological uncertainty? So, do we see clearly enough through space and time?</li>
<li>What is the degree of flexibility of the project?</li>
<li>Question your own strategy</li>
</ul>
<p>There is nothing worse than to keep going on a strategy that is already known to be doomed. You can&#8217;t win against the market, against the customers, against more powerful competitors.</p>
<p>First, you&#8217;ll try to adapt the project to environmental conditions by redefining:</p>
<ul>
<li>The target customers</li>
<li>The ways to reach them</li>
<li>Changing the business model if needed</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, it is very wise to stop a project at the right time, as instead of wearing yourself out pursuing an elusive goal, you can redirect the energy for a new project. Fail fast is the mantra you should imbibe.</p>
<h3>Market Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Volume Growth vs Value Growth</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The evolution of prices is derived from these two domains &#8211; volume and value. If the market is in volume growth, it is necessary to invest in capacity and financing of working capital. Also, the company should be able to rely on its profitability partially to support the prices.</p>
<p>The growth of a market usually follows an S-curve, it is stable in the start, then accelerate, and then stabilizes in the due course of time.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-987 alignleft" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/growth-300x247.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="247" /></p>
<p>The growth dynamics depend on two phenomena:</p>
<ul>
<li>Penetration</li>
<li>Consumption</li>
</ul>
<p>So the market can grow either by increasing the number of consumers using the product or by increasing their consumption.</p>
<p>Three fundamental questions remain to be answered clearly:</p>
<ul>
<li>How fast will the product get in the market? &#8211; delayed products give the edge to competitors to bring the similar products</li>
<li>Penetration levels at which growth can slow down? &#8211; after that what you should do</li>
<li>On what timescale &#8211; slow or fast?</li>
</ul>
<p>A market is rarely 100% saturated, you can always think about what is the maximum level of penetration that is possible?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Substitution</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, a startup arrives on the existing market with a more or less innovative offer. So it will present a substitute for what already exists.</p>
<p>You may think that your innovation will solve a very important health or safety problem,  customers should rush to buy your offer and leave their old behaviours behind. You will have to manage to substitute your offer to the old one, even if the old behaviour was not present or it was not to do anything. You will have to convince people to change.</p>
<p>The growth of your project will depend on the speed of this substitution. So it is important to understand the obstacles, the reluctances and to deeply analyse the decision-making process of the buyers.</p>
<p>Be aware of the psychological obstacles. Habits are hard to change because the consumers must unlearn a practice that always satisfied him/her and adopt a new technology, a new way of doing that carries risks which are sometimes too important.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Customer Behaviour</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Different kinds of consumers, so many distinct markets, several targets. So you must segment in order to refine the analysis and your business model.</p>
<p>What consequences can a forecasting error have?  Two major consequences appear. On a given date, incomes are not realised. The number of consumers, and so the sales revenue, are way below the forecast.</p>
<p>Pamper your first customers. They will be demanding, but they will help you develop your product, they will make you progress. Furthermore, they will be your most loyal defenders, and often your most effective advertisements.</p>
<p>After your first customers are satisfied or you can say short-term success, at the same time, make the necessary decisions to work with techniques to perfect the development of the product and its offerings, collect funds so that your project can continue and you can work on new ideas or improve the offerings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When learning about how to use a telescope and how to make one yourself, we came across a very good site [1] maintained by Will Kalif and were impressed by the content on the website, it is the culmination of years of experience and insights.</p>
<p>Later we got to know that Mr Will Kalif has also published a book on telescopes titled &#8220;See It with a Small Telescope: 101 Cosmic Wonders&#8221; and we thought to give it a try for our ventures into the night sky and for our readers. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Will received his first telescope as a Christmas present and motivated many people since then after feeling the joy of watching heavens himself.</span></p>
<p>After reading the book, the first thing come to mind is &#8211; to the point and clear. This book is written primarily for novice and amateurs, it introduces the concept at the basic level and expands it if it is required. Author motivates the amateurs not to give up, start small, and keep trying until it works.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book talks richness of the night sky f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rom the moon, to 60 million years far spiral galaxy, to cluster &#8211; like Galileo found them. The sky is not just filled with only s</span>tars but there are different objects galaxies, nebulae, planets, etc.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-935 size-large" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180528_003025_cp-1024x479.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="374" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will points that don’t compare your telescope experience with the Hubble but enjoy the pleasure of observing things yourself and appreciating it. Readers are</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> encouraged to read in sequence but you can skip to the chapter of interest based on your experience.</span></p>
<p>It is very important to set up your telescope in advance to let its optics adjust to the temperature and humidity, yes it adjusts. Most of the pictures used in the books are captured by small telescopes like 6” or less.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The book b</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rings clarity to the thoughts and the process of observation in a step by step manner. No extra fillers are used, the author talks directly to the point in a logical manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to know and use star charts and catalogues like Messier and NGC (New General Catalog) along with the details </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of magnitude and international convention of celestial coordinates with best viewing months, this book covers that too. You can start with e</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">asy to find objects like the moon, Jupiter, Saturn, M 13 globular, Andromeda and Orion nebula and then expand into deep sky objects slowly as they are covered in their own chapter.</span></p>
<p>The book is divided into 11 chapters with first 3 chapters are dedicated to the basics ranging from telescopes to astrophotography to our galaxy milky way.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-937 size-full" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/toc.jpg" alt="" width="594" height="650" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telescopes parts, filters, mounting and viewing technique are covered in basic details. Important researched items are also included like using the side of the eye than the centre (averted vision) along with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">common Q&amp;A like why and what to do when a telescope is having vibration, an object is in upside down position?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Piggybacking, afocal, prime focus, eyepiece projection photography techniques are also introduced to the readers in the book.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-931 size-large" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180527_152307_cp-1024x498.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="389" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Navigating the night sky by l</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ocating the cloudy band of the milky way, spotting Ursa (major and minor), Cassiopeia, Cygnus are covered in each separate chapters. The concept of e</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cliptic path containing all the planets and sun, the moon is very important one and the author has highlighted it on several occasions. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-933 size-large" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180528_003121_cp-1024x436.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="341" /></p>
<p>Overall the whole book is an interesting read and must be part of every beginner&#8217;s collection. Will has managed to bring in many years of his passion into a well defined and to the point content that readers will enjoy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Managing an innovative projects focus on</p>
<ol>
<li>Reducing uncertainty by planning</li>
<li>Creating hypotheses</li>
<li>Get into action mode quickly to confirm or reject hypotheses</li>
<li>Convert hypotheses into knowledge &#8211; Discovery</li>
<li>Path to the discovery</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step is the coming up with hypotheses on</p>
<ol>
<li>Business model</li>
<li>Technology</li>
<li>Competition</li>
<li>Partners</li>
</ol>
<p>Each hypothesis will be tracked on following topics</p>
<ol>
<li>Its basis</li>
<li>Its effort estimation</li>
<li>Its owner</li>
<li>Its progress</li>
</ol>
<p>Critical hypotheses will also be identified that can affect several elements, has an important effect on performances, the feasibility of the project, important investments.</p>
<h4>Planning</h4>
<p>Milestones will also be planned where the main hypotheses will be discussed. For each milestone, there will be a target fixed &#8211; the hypotheses and the costs etc. Each milestone is used to validate at least one hypothesis, each hypothesis must be validated at least with one milestone, e.g. a critical milestone is used to validate a critical hypothesis.</p>
<h4>Acceptance</h4>
<p>From a hypothesis, design an experiment to</p>
<ol>
<li>Measure the gaps</li>
<li>learn and rephrase the hypothesis</li>
<li>Move to the next one</li>
</ol>
<p>Eric Ries recommends multiple of these learning loops and the reduction of their cost. These experiments require a minimum viable product that can be demonstrated. It isn&#8217;t a prototype, it is much simpler. The idea is to experiment the functionalities as soon as possible.</p>
<p>With early adopters accepting faults and actively participating to improve the product, you mustn&#8217;t specify it precisely, but let the missing features be underlined by negative feedbacks.</p>
<p>So you must organise these experiments early on and experiment often reduces the cost, set back the commitment of important and irreversible costs and multiply the methods to acquire knowledge. In other words, managing an innovative project is going the traditional way of project management but taking the uncertainties into account.</p>
<h4>Approach</h4>
<p>The structured and systematic approach should be followed. It is even more necessary in the case of an innovative project as cognitive bias have been identified by psychologists working on creators of innovative businesses and innovative project managers.</p>
<p>We often keep in mind information reinforcing the chosen hypotheses, reject information challenging these hypotheses. We tend to forget the hypothetical nature and the fragile baselines, overestimate success and undervalue risks.</p>
<p>We become optimistic and it is a good point. The role of managing tools of innovative projects is to go along with this optimism but through the structured and thorough tools leaving any bias</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>In the closing remarks, managing an innovative project means to work on three areas</p>
<ol>
<li>Grow knowledge and reduce uncertainties using multiple experiments</li>
<li>Build cohesion within the team</li>
<li>Bring common direction as the team may change as the project grows</li>
</ol>
<p>Please share your experience or ideas how we can manage these kinds of projects.</p>

<p>A teacher needs to recognize that they&#8217;re not working alone, It&#8217;s very easy for teachers to become isolated within their classrooms and also with their problems.</p>
<p>A few years back, teachers used to feel happy to go to seniors (head/principal) and talk openly about the problems they were facing, but now it is very difficult to think and do. Now, we live in a situation in schools in which people and the idea of collaboration are slowly disappearing.</p>
<p>Teaching is about learning and developing certain skills, certain competencies and keeping certain strategies at your disposal. Without empathy and considerations about social economic backgrounds of students, these competencies become very unhelpful for teachers and it produces a very limited idea of what teaching is.</p>
<p>But without questions, there are going to be no answers. And so the importance of asking questions is being recognized and a lot more now. We always remember a teacher who has touched us in some way. For a good teacher, children think he is one of them and one of us too. Teaching isn&#8217;t just about certain skills, competencies, strategies, etc., there&#8217;s something else that is also required.</p>
<h4>Reflective Practice</h4>
<p>Reflection practice challenges assumptions that we bring with us into teaching and it questions us how we should do things differently in a better way. It reinforces our belief in what we do. Challenging our assumption is very difficult thing to do because we don&#8217;t know what our assumptions are and that&#8217;s the reason they&#8217;re called assumptions.</p>
<p>During our lifetime we develop certain mental frameworks &#8211; ways of understanding the world, experiencing the world. new experiences, new information. Instead of changing the way we look at the world, we try to manipulate this new experience to challenge it. We try to manipulate it in such a way that we can fit it into our existing understandings. You know, I think we all understand how, how we do this. and, you know, these are our assumptions.</p>
<p>If we don&#8217;t challenge our assumptions, we would always just stay the way that we are and nothing grows with us.</p>
<h4>Reflexive teaching</h4>
<p>Reflexivity encourages us to understand our practice in relation to the society/the world in which we live. We should understand how our students socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds have an impact on how they experience schooling.  It is not about thinking just ourselves in isolation, about our personal qualities, our competencies, it&#8217;s about developing an understanding of the impact of students lives outside of school, on the way they are and the way they learn inside the school. It would include, for example, understanding the impact of emotions on students.</p>
<p>Understanding behavior more in terms of what happens outside of school and developing appropriate ways of dealing with not just dismissing someone&#8217;s behavior as bad, or unacceptable. We may feel we need to punish bad behavior but teaching is about trying to understand it in terms of a student&#8217;s wider life. We cannot just treat our emotions as things that we can just dump any place conveniently. We carry them with us all the time, we are humans.</p>
<p>The most important thing we&#8217;re encouraged to leave out the classroom or interaction our feelings &#8211; Teachers are not supposed to have feelings. This is wrong. We need to support our kids emotionally by understanding why they are behaving in a particular manner by asking questions so that they can explain.</p>
<p>We need to be an ear to them who don&#8217;t ignore them and listen to them with embrace and compassion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Intelligence &#8211; as we know it</h4>
<p>How do you define Intelligence and what do you mean by when you say somebody is more intelligent than others. We have to go back in time when during 1930s intelligence was defined by what intelligence test measure. There were also many types of intelligence defined and that was too much. It is also strange to measure the intelligence by tests.</p>
<p>Actually, it&#8217;s quite deep, because a person&#8217;s view of intelligence decides how intelligence tests are developed. Intelligence tests focus on verbal, spatial, number reasoning because that&#8217;s what was the predominant view of what intelligent people demonstrate.</p>
<h4>Intelligence &#8211; the reasonable explanation</h4>
<p>People denotes intelligence in terms of ability &#8211; low ability, high ability, no ability, it is mostly found in schools. It is worrisome the way the world &#8216;ability&#8217; is being used &#8211; It is not used in the sense that kids haven&#8217;t developed the ability but they haven&#8217;t got it when born. They are born with a lot of or not much ability that causes learning. It should be actually the ability to develop the ability, so it should be a measure of learning, not the cause of learning.</p>
<p>Are we born with the same ability that we develop more as we go through schooling?  The answer is we&#8217;re born with certain capacities, how they develop really depends on the environment, the stimulation. We all have a capacity for language, but the language we speak and to what extent depends on our culture and society. If we live in the jungle we don&#8217;t develop the language capability.</p>
<h4>Environment and its importance</h4>
<p>There may be ranges of capacities, but the key thing is the way they interact with the environment. So if you have a really deprived environment it&#8217;s going to be very difficult to come out with high ability because you&#8217;ve not had the stimulation, you&#8217;ve not had the structures and support.  That&#8217;s why, often, we see such big and clearly visible differences between kids who come from very poor backgrounds and kids from privileged backgrounds.</p>
<p>Along with language, this holds true for reading, privileged kids would have more exposure to books, exposure to stories and lessons. As a result, the ability to use reading to learn is developed more rather than just struggling to learn to read.</p>
<h4>Multiplier to capabilities</h4>
<p>There are small multipliers where we have a small advantage in each but combined they create a bigger impact and advantage. For example, if you are slightly better at kicking a football and you&#8217;re probably slightly older and slightly bigger, so people will say that you are talented and you should go for more coaching or training. With practice, you get better and become part of the state or national team. You get better coaching and very soon people start saying, he&#8217;s a natural or born footballer. Take the story of David Beckham who started kicking the ball when he was three years old. His dad was coaching him that time.</p>
<p>You get better coaching and very soon people start saying, he&#8217;s a natural or born footballer. Take the story of David Beckham who started kicking the ball when he was three years old. His dad was coaching him that time. People used to say that this small kid can hit the ball very far and can bend free kicks. But they didn&#8217;t know that he was practising almost every day. For kids with small advantages,  it accumulates with time more and more. Other kids can&#8217;t make this progress due to the absence of similar stimulation and family background.</p>
<h4>Developing capabilities &#8211; deliberate practice</h4>
<p>Deliberate (intentional) practice is the secret and it is more related to what you are born with and raised with &#8211; resilience and being able to push yourself, keep going in tough situations. We are not born with these hard-wired skills &#8211; are you born tennis player &#8211; do you learn tennis in the womb and start playing when coming out. It is also true for musicians, artists, CEOs, etc. Deliberate practice is to do with opportunities we get and resilient dedication to practice to make the learning ability strong and automatic.</p>
<p>Malcolm Gladwell and his outlier study say nobody gets to the top of anything without putting 10,000 hours (for 3 years &#8211; 3hrs daily) of deliberate practice, it seems true for musicians, sportspersons, etc. Deliberate practice is where you are fighting for things that you are not good at and eventually get better and better.</p>
<p>To improve is quite difficult, mentally challenging and tiring if you&#8217;re doing it properly otherwise you are just enjoying things when they work out and abandon them when they don&#8217;t work.</p>
<h4>Deliberate practice &#8211; how it works</h4>
<p>Achievers have got more flexible and stronger mental framework to make sense of stuff, they see the bigger picture quicker and better than a novice. They can make sense of the new stuff they see and interact with it quickly rather than getting confused.</p>
<p>How you can use this practice &#8211; first thing is to have opportunities and choices. Why don&#8217;t some kids learn or not interested in learning? Most schools never link to the stuff kids really interested in (can we find out what kids are interested in?).</p>
<p>Do we give them choices they&#8217;re interested in? No, almost all the schools are focussing on cramming and pushing kids through a curriculum with exams. Everybody is good at something. It&#8217;s just that we don&#8217;t find out it more often. There are many kids who learned nothing in school but can tell you everything you wanted to know about the planets, cycles, sports they like, etc. There are many kids who couldn&#8217;t remember poems could recite the lyrics of their fav songs. There is a clear mismatch between kids and schools/society, we couldn&#8217;t make the links with them.</p>
<p>Take another example, this time of Bill Gates, his computing skills developed because the school had a computing room with a mainframe terminal. This setup was very rare in the universities but he got it in school. He could do programming and the school just let him do it. By the age of 15, he was doing payroll programming for quite large companies with his mate and he was approached by a very big utility company when he was ~18. School supported him for this project for taking credit of the cooperation. He went for three months to put Westinghouse&#8217;s payroll together and things like this and ideas of cashing in kept on developing and becoming stronger with time. This happened because he got the choices, opportunities, and support.</p>
<p>Nurture the kids like they are free birds with different opportunities around &#8211; let them pick some and you support them in encouragement and teachings. Trust them and listen them more than you talk.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Build on &#8211; expose the world to them</h4>
<p>Find out what your child actually knows and understands, rather than assuming. Asking them good questions would expose many misconceptions and misunderstandings about the world to them. Imagine with little older kids, if we&#8217;re talking about the earth rotation, its orbit, our solar system, they can tell us what is earth and other planets. But can they tell what causes an eclipse? Make better questioning part of life by asking open-ended questions that give us evidence about what and how does this kid understand or not understand.</p>
<h4>Make base strong &#8211; don&#8217;t feed them</h4>
<p>They might tell that the sun is moving around the earth and not the other way which is wrong but hold on. Also ask, why is it night in India when it&#8217;s day in the USA. You&#8217;ll expose them to some very basic scientific fundamentals that you can build on. Kids can come up with totally weird answers and we tend to correct them with the right answers. Rather we should ask them where did they get the answer from, how did they think about it? If you keep feeding them right answers you might never know what is wrong in their thinking process and how they arrive at a particular answer.</p>
<h4>Big picture and Feedback</h4>
<p>As parents, we should show them the bigger picture to make them understand what&#8217;s going on here. It is a very critical piece in their life and growth as they might not connect with the bigger picture when they are doing something. It can affect their interest and motivation.</p>
<p>Another very important area where the parents must be involved all the time is feedback. What kind of feedback do you give? Most of the time it empty and useless feedback. Feedback should be very specific and task focussed and should produce a set of corrective actions.</p>
<p>See the sports coaches, they diagnose whatever the particular sportsperson is doing well and not doing well and then focuses in on the things they need to improve. The importance of the big picture and growth in a skill are very critical aspects of feedback.</p>
<p>Help kids in know what are they doing, why are they doing and how they can make sense of it. It&#8217;s kind of chess board game, If you know the rules of the game, if you can spot the patterns, you&#8217;ve got a much more powerful memory than if all you&#8217;re trying to remember a few pieces and games that you already played.</p>
<h4>Imagination</h4>
<p>Help them imagine what will it be like if they are successful (doing something they love and want to do)? Many successful people imagine themselves doing things and dreaming about achieving the goals and the life they want to have, coach the kids with this principle &#8211; imagining, believing, working and achieving.</p>
<h4>Ability or disability induction</h4>
<p>Don&#8217;t focus on the word or rather forget the word &#8211; ability, rather work with kind of apprenticeship model, where you talk about somebody being naive, novice, apprentice, expert, master as they learn, do, and progress.</p>
<p>Life is a learning process, it is about the work itself not about the kid. Ability is all about reputations, labels, and that really interferes with how teachers and schools treat kids. The biggest difference between a good teacher and a normal teacher is the level of the cognitive demand of the work they set their kids, all the kids.</p>
<p>Expert/good teachers expect more from all of their kids, not just the bright ones. They expect them to do deep learning work which is understanding themselves, making sense of it for themselves. So stay away from the word ability and demand more of our children, all the children.</p>
<p>If you’re told that you are high ability or low ability, It doesn’t take you far for certainly. But If you are told that you can do something well or you can do something better, it gives you a lot of possibilities and opportunities.</p>
<p>By putting kids into ability groups is very harmful, kids at the top get the more imaginative, better, more creative and kids at the bottom are treated as they&#8217;re not going to do well. Kids at the bottom are event told that you are less capable and not in the same league. The gap widens with time and distorts the thinking process and confidence of kids. It is like we are writing a script for them at that point about what they can and can&#8217;t do without really testing it out, without really giving them opportunities, without understanding them.</p>
<p>Kids (ours and others) are like flowers and nature, each has its own beauty and variations, we should nurture it rather than segregating them and damaging them to the core.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5>Forceful learning</h5>
<p>kids know better how they learn rather than somebody teaching/telling them how to learn. Teachers should create an environment for allowing kids to discuss how they learn better and talk openly. But this is not the case in most of the institutions as most of the focus is on forcefully broadcasting textbooks via mouth and not creating a conducive and collaborative environment. The possible reasons can be, it takes more time and energy and it can impact revenue per kid or they have never thought of it.</p>
<p>This clearly shows one signal that particular school or institution either doing it intentionally or unintentionally. If it is intentional then future of kids are in risky hands and if it is unintentional then again the future of kids are in risky hands as the people in charge don&#8217;t do research about learning and don&#8217;t learn themselves.</p>
<p>Kids are very delicate, a proper environment should be provided to them to nurture with freedom as well as discipline. They should feel free to talk openly and not scared of the teachers. I have seen kids including at my home, they are so afraid of teacher and think that they will only do work as given by the teacher and not other work as we are not teachers.</p>
<p>There is a general principle of active learning (<a href="http://weatherhead.case.edu/executive-education/instructors/david-kolb">David Kolb</a>) given below.</p>
<pre><strong>(do -&gt; review -&gt; learn -&gt; apply )</strong>

<strong>+ with many reflection cycles (for understanding how did you tackle the task and what learning you can take to do it better next time)</strong></pre>
<p>There are few misconceptions about what makes a better learner, let&#8217;s discuss them in the section below.</p>
<h5>The misconceptions about better learner</h5>
<p>It is very hard to formulate that study harder makes a better learner. We don&#8217;t fully understand peoples&#8217; different backgrounds, family culture as well as their social networking and these all things also affect the learning goals and reach. Take the example of Einstein who was kicked out of school and failed many exams but this didn&#8217;t affect his learning and output.</p>
<p>So we can say that a good learner is a person who&#8217;s always open to learning, networking, taking risks. We need to read research about learning to understand better what is going on the field and what are the latest findings on learning. This will help us in imbibing those learning in our learning approach and it may add value to the existing methodologies that we are following.</p>
<h5>Approach</h5>
<p>We need to learn on our own and then discuss the learning in a group, it can be in person or on a social platform like online forums, Whatsapp, Facebook, etc. Learning is impactful if it is done in groups that are collaborating and interacting with each other frequently. Along with learning, collaboration builds social skills which in-turn make learning more enjoyable and strong with top notch output.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learning can be divided into 4 parts and greatly depends on the learner&#8217;s purpose.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5><strong>Learning to know</strong></h5>
<p>Reading, enquiry, etc.</li>
<li>
<h5><strong>Learning to do</strong></h5>
<p>Building a model, tool, etc.</li>
<li>
<h5><strong>Learning to live in society</strong></h5>
<p>Studying the life and behaviour of life and society to live</li>
<li>
<h5><strong>Learning to be self-aware</strong></h5>
<p>Awareness of our mind, body, etc. to live a happy and healthy life</li>
</ol>
<p>Being scared or more disciplined may hinder the learning process and critical thinking for us and especially kids as they are learning the world around them. Kids should be provided with a comfortable and approachable environment where they should be free to use diverse methods for thinking and collaborating.</p>
<h4>Traditional classroom</h4>
<p>Traditionally classroom teaching or learning is more focussed on maintaining silence where kids are told not to speak and interact loudly to each other. This environment hampers their brain development in the long run. Kids are even scolded and given punishment for speaking differently than teachers. You would remember the scene (linked below) from PK movie that signifies that this even prevails in universities.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="What is a machine? - Funny scene | 3 Idiots | Aamir Khan | R Madhavan | Sharman Joshi" width="750" height="422" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-MlkASchodc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Traditional classrooms or even today&#8217;s classrooms have teachers to<a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.ENRL.TC.ZS"> students ratio ~1:30 or more</a> and this means personalised learning is not inherently possible as a teacher have too many students to reach and teach. This result in a coercive method (mostly one way from teacher to students) which is harmful to learning.</p>
<h4>Authority versus Authoritarian</h4>
<p>Teachers become authoritarian (running their own rules, forceful way of teaching, punishment, etc.) instead of authority on the subjects (expert in their fields). This way of working is not healthy for open thinking and discussions. Kids are scared to even to speak simple things and their growth becomes stagnant.</p>
<h4>New model &#8211; Progressive</h4>
<p>There is a need for the new model called progressive, personalised,  or constructive teaching. These paradigms focus that kids make meaning and understand things by experiencing themselves. They make sense of their surroundings and world, the teacher can act as a catalyst to spark the excitement and curiosity. This spark is the most important impression that will be with them all their life and guide their thought process and actions.</p>
<p>Please share your thoughts in the comment section or by reaching to us. We are planning to start a revolution in the way kids are taught and they learn. Keep an eye for the announcement in coming months from us.</p>
