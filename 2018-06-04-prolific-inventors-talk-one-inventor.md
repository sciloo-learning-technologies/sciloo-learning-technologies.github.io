Many of us know that Edison holds around 1084 patent but do you know he doesn&#8217;t have the highest number of patents. The highest number of patents at the time of this writings are 5183, almost 5 times than Edison&#8217;s. In this article, I will summarize my learnings from one of such inventors &#8211; Mark Johnson \[2\] (holds more than 500 patents, but not on the list).

<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-953 size-full" src="http://sciloo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/patents.jpg" alt="" width="689" height="457" /> 

From here on, the article will present as if Mark Johnson is talking to you directly.

### Start

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t learn to be an inventor, I was interested in s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">olving problem, got the first assignment with the deadline of 3 months. I worked for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 months on vibration reduction from the magnetic tape in tape recorder and player. After that, I worked on f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">errite core transformer (having small size but high frequencies) for ~4 years.</span>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">Nobel prize years</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I was working on the similar technologies ( Giant magnetoresistance [3] ) for which- Nobel prize was awarded, this invention had applications in the video recorder, hard disk, etc. and ultimately used to shrink the size of these devices and many more.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was important because it is highly sensitive (low magnetic force high resistance change) and gives easy detection.</span>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">Moores law &#8211; increase in no of inventions per year by Mark</span>

I initially worked on materials and then my organization thought I should focus on display now as we were focussing on TV display or general purpose display in Philips. When we started working on display we got the following.

  1. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Lcd &#8211; 20 patent</span>
  2. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Oled &#8211; 40 patent</span>
  3. <span style="font-weight: 400;">e-ink &#8211; 100 patents</span>

Still, we were not leaders in display technologies.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We were working on the Flat panel, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low power reflective display and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inventors were leading the planning and executions of these project rather than project management guys. My c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">olleague invented 3 out of 10 display technologies in the market but those were not where we could earn the money for the business. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in AMOLED technology, we were the 2nd company to work out the technology and build the first working model.</span>

During these years, I noticed that I was filing patents double than the previous year just like CPU power is doubled every year.

### Paper-like display

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We were the first on paper like display &#8211; building the prototype and developing a working technology. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon was taking e-ink display from a company which was using license of this Philips technology (there were 100s of patents) from Philips.</span>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">Big challenge </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then we needed to come up with next big challenges and after utilizing the experience and literature we came to following topics where work could be done.</span>

  1. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Neuroscience </span>
  2. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Emotions</span>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">Reconnaissance</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We needed to work on high-risk high reward ideas but the first step was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hypothesis testing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; fail hypothesis fastest. We picked later different ideas ranging from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food, hair to teeth whitening which was very successful.</span>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">Process of inventions</span>

  1. <span style="font-weight: 400;">First scope</span>
  2. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, the idea to implement or patent</span>
  3. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Problems &#8211; how to solve them</span>
  4. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior art &#8211; value of the tech, competitors</span>
  5. <span style="font-weight: 400;">determine the approach </span> 
      1. <span style="font-weight: 400;">    No art &#8211; direct patent</span>
      2. <span style="font-weight: 400;">    Some &#8211; workaround</span>
      3. <span style="font-weight: 400;">    Much art  avoid or circumvention (use TRIZ technique)</span>
  6. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Find a specific problem that valuable control points</span>
  7. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about 5 to 10 years in future</span>
  8. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Evaluate on feasibility, novelty, desirability</span>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">The format of a patent</span>

  1. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspiration</span>
  2. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Short description</span>
  3. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Illustration of invention</span>
  4. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Main tech feature</span>
  5. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Main prior art</span>

### Advice

  1. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Work out of your comfort zone</span>
  2. <span style="font-weight: 400;">No need to be expert, just do your work</span>
  3. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Material patents are most valuable</span>
  4. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Spread out across teams and projects to best spread the process (instead of passive communication or emails)</span>
  5. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The inexperienced team can be productive with the well laid out process</span>
  6. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Be the first to spot and get problems &#8211; snatch opportunities</span>
  7. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Listening to the experience of 20-30 years is better than one or two sessions on current technology.</span>
