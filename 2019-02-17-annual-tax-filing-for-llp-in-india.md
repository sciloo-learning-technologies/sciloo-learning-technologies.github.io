#  **LLP Stakeholders**

  1. Your LLP &#8211; you
  2. MCA &#8211; for yearly compliance
  3. Income Tax Dept &#8211; for income tax
  4. State govt &#8211; professional tax

**Recommendation**

Don&#8217;t wait for the last date, when you have all the data, fill the form asasp and submit it. Near the last date, things happen very fast, your CA might be very busy and you have to pay penalty if your CA takes more time. There is a chance of website going down or be under heavy load which can delay your filings and may results in penalty.
