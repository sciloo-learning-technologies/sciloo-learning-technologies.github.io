Alerting all hungry souls! NASA has opened the gates to its research results [1] for the public. Agency has demonstrated its commitment to the open and global innovation during this move. In a similar move, during 2014, Tesla motors unveiled all its patents to the public to encourage more impactful and socially wide research on electrical vehicles.

You can find the following information on the portal \[1\]\[2\].

  * Human space explorations and missions
  * Astrophysics related
  * Science strategy and plans
  * Space related technologies
  * Aeronautics research

Refer the image which was taken from a research paper on Titan [3]  where the presence of an atmosphere, water, lakes, methane, ethane, etc. are detected.

You would be thinking, research papers are fine but what about the data. In addition to the papers, NASA has fulfilled your wish by giving open access to the data that was used in the experiments and research through its data portal [4].

NASA Deputy Administrator Dava Newman said, &#8220;_At NASA, we are celebrating this opportunity to extend access to our extensive portfolio of scientific and technical publications&#8221;._ &#8220;Through open access and innovation, we invite the global community to join us in exploring Earth, air and space.&#8221;
