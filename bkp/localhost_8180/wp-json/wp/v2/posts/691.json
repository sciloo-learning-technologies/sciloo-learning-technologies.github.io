Our skin produces more than 340 chemical odours, and some of them smell like dinner to mosquitoes. They are fond of octenol, a chemical released in sweat, as well as cholesterol, folic acid, certain bacteria, skin lotions, and perfume.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The majority of mosquitoes feed around evening and at dawn. The dry heat that often occurs during daylight hours in the summer can quickly kill mosquitoes by causing them to become dehydrated. As such, most mosquitoes rest or sleep in a dark, sheltered place during the daylight hours, preferably an area that is relatively humid, such as tucked inside vegetation like plants and grass. They also can be found sleeping the day away inside man-made structures like culverts or barns, or natural shelters such as caves, holes in the ground, and holes in trees. \u00a0They spend their first 10 days in water. The lifespan of a female adult mosquito is 42-56 days and for Male adult, it is 10days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By keeping the windows and doors closed between 5 p.m. and 10 p.m and again in the early morning, one can prevent the entry of these mosquitoes into the house.
