Let&#8217;s see on what principles strategy can be prepared.<\/p>\n<h3>Four Fundamentals of Strategy<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>Victory<\/h4>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Your goal must be not to be a marginal competitor\u00a0expecting to hold 1 or 2% of the market share, it\u00a0is equivalent to making the ambition marginal and\u00a0also admitting implicitly that your innovation is not so powerful and attractive.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>Build on strengths<\/h4>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Identify the key strengths of your project\/innovation,\u00a0the characteristics that make it competitive and winning.\u00a0Look for the points of differentiation\u00a0which will make the difference with competitors.\u00a0Invest in these key strengths to increase the difference.<\/p>\n<p>Try to identify the weakness that makes you a real handicap against your competitors and invest to eliminate them and\u00a0ignore the other weaknesses.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>Risk estimation<\/h4>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Any creative project includes risks, so this is not about eliminating them, but comprehend them and minimise them as much as possible.\u00a0Dimensions below can be taken into consideration for this.<\/p>\n<p>How reliable can changes in the environment\u00a0be predicted?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the degree of technological uncertainty?\u00a0So, do we see clearly enough through space and time?<\/li>\n<li>What is the degree of flexibility of the project?<\/li>\n<li>Question your own strategy<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There is nothing worse than to keep going on a strategy that\u00a0is already known to be doomed.\u00a0You can&#8217;t win against the market,\u00a0against the customers, against more powerful competitors.<\/p>\n<p>First, you&#8217;ll try to adapt the project to environmental conditions\u00a0by redefining:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The target customers<\/li>\n<li>The ways to\u00a0reach them<\/li>\n<li>Changing the business model if needed<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In some cases, it is very wise to stop a project at the right\u00a0time, as instead of wearing yourself out pursuing an elusive goal,\u00a0you can redirect the energy for a new project. Fail fast is the mantra you should imbibe.<\/p>\n<h3>Market Considerations<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>Volume Growth vs Value Growth<\/h4>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The evolution of prices is derived from these two domains &#8211; volume and value.\u00a0If the market is in volume growth, it is\u00a0necessary to invest in capacity and financing of working capital. Also, the company should be able to rely\u00a0on its profitability partially to support the prices.<\/p>\n<p>The growth of a market usually follows an S-curve, it is stable in the start, then accelerate, and then stabilizes in the due course of time.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-987 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/growth-300x247.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"247\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The growth dynamics depend on two phenomena:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Penetration<\/li>\n<li>Consumption<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So the market can grow either by increasing the number of consumers\u00a0using the product or by increasing their consumption.<\/p>\n<p>Three fundamental questions remain to be answered clearly:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How fast will the product get in the market? &#8211; delayed products give the edge to competitors to bring the similar products<\/li>\n<li>Penetration levels at which\u00a0growth can slow down? &#8211; after that what you should do<\/li>\n<li>On what timescale &#8211; slow or fast?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A market is rarely 100% saturated,\u00a0you can always think about\u00a0what is the maximum level of penetration that is possible?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>Substitution<\/h4>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Generally, a startup arrives on the\u00a0existing market with a more or less innovative offer.\u00a0So it will present a substitute for what already exists.<\/p>\n<p>You may think that your innovation will solve a very important health\u00a0or safety problem,\u00a0\u00a0customers should rush to buy your offer and leave\u00a0their old behaviours behind.\u00a0You will have to manage to substitute your offer to the old one,\u00a0even if the old behaviour was not present or it was not to do anything.\u00a0You will have to convince people to change.<\/p>\n<p>The growth of your project will depend on the speed of this substitution.\u00a0So it is important to understand the obstacles, the reluctances and\u00a0to deeply analyse the decision-making process of the buyers.<\/p>\n<p>Be aware of the psychological obstacles.\u00a0Habits are hard to change because the consumers must unlearn a practice\u00a0that always satisfied him\/her\u00a0and adopt a new technology, a new way of doing that carries\u00a0risks which are sometimes too important.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>Customer Behaviour<\/h4>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Different kinds of consumers, so many\u00a0distinct markets, several targets.\u00a0So you must segment in order to refine the analysis and\u00a0your business model.<\/p>\n<p>What consequences can a forecasting error have?\u00a0\u00a0Two major consequences appear.\u00a0On a given date, incomes are not realised.\u00a0The number of consumers,\u00a0and so the sales revenue, are way below the forecast.<\/p>\n<p>Pamper your first customers.\u00a0They will be demanding, but they will help you develop your product,\u00a0they will make you progress.\u00a0Furthermore, they will be your most loyal defenders,\u00a0and often your most effective advertisements.<\/p>\n<p>After your\u00a0first customers are satisfied or you can say short-term success,\u00a0at the same time, make the necessary decisions to work with techniques to\u00a0perfect the development of the product and its offerings, collect funds so that your project can continue and you can work on new ideas or improve the offerings.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Core of any Business People don&#8217;t make more mistakes in management from\u00a0wrong answers to right questions\u00a0but from right answers to wrong questions, yet people generally spend more time finding the answer than identifying\u00a0the relevant questions. 3 Pillars of Startup Expertise Resources Aspirations Should we adapt to find the strategy according to the resources or&hellip; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/2018\/06\/24\/startup-strategy\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Strategy for Startups &#8211; Fundamentals and Market<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2,232,132],"tags":[262,135,261],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/753"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=753"}],"version-history":[{"count":25,"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/753\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1017,"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/753\/revisions\/1017"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=753"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=753"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=753"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
