This book is written primarily for novice and amateurs, it introduces the concept at the basic level and expands it if it is required. Author motivates the amateurs not to give up, start small, and keep trying until it works.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The book talks richness of the night sky f<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rom the moon, to 60 million years far spiral galaxy, to cluster &#8211; like Galileo found them. The sky is not just filled with only s<\/span>tars but there are different objects galaxies, nebulae, planets, etc.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-935 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/IMG_20180528_003025_cp-1024x479.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"374\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will points that don\u2019t compare your telescope experience with the Hubble but enjoy the pleasure of observing things yourself and appreciating it. Readers are<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0encouraged to read in sequence but you can skip to the chapter of interest based on your experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>It is very important to set up your telescope in advance to let its optics adjust to the temperature and humidity, yes it adjusts. Most of the\u00a0pictures used in the books are captured by small telescopes like 6\u201d or less.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0The book b<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rings clarity to the thoughts and the process of observation in a step by step manner. No extra fillers are used, the author talks directly to the point in a logical manner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to know and use star charts and catalogues like Messier and NGC (New General Catalog) along with the details <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of magnitude and international convention of celestial coordinates with best viewing months, this book covers that too. You can start with e<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">asy to find objects like the moon, Jupiter, Saturn, M 13 globular, Andromeda and Orion nebula and then expand into deep sky objects slowly as they are covered in their own chapter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The book is divided into 11 chapters with first 3 chapters are dedicated to the basics ranging from telescopes to astrophotography to our galaxy milky way.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-937 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/toc.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"594\" height=\"650\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Telescopes parts, filters, mounting and viewing technique are covered in basic details. Important researched items are also included like using the side of the eye than the centre (averted vision) along with\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">common Q&amp;A like why and what to do when a telescope is having vibration, an object is in upside down position?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Piggybacking, afocal, prime focus, eyepiece projection photography techniques are also introduced to the readers in the book.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-931 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/IMG_20180527_152307_cp-1024x498.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"389\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Navigating the night sky by l<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ocating the cloudy band of the milky way, spotting Ursa (major and minor), Cassiopeia, Cygnus are covered in each separate chapters.
