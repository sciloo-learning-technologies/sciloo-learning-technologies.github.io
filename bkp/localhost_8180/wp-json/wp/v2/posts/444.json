It gives assurance to your customers that their data is safe from hackers and eavesdroppers.<\/p>\n<p>But if you see, setting up SSL is a costly affair. People are spending 100s $ and 1000s\u00a0\u20b9 on SSL certificates and setup cost. See the screenshot below for one such SSL certificate pricing for the\u00a0Indian market. It becomes more costly if you need separate SSL certificates for each of your subdomains.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-445 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8180\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/sslratesgodaddy-1024x516.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"403\" \/><\/p>\n<p>People have the basic notion in their mind that setting up SSL for their website is a tedious task and it belongs to experts.\u00a0But letsencrypt.org has changed this perception by providing the SSL for the free and available provision of an easy setup either through the <a href=\"http:\/\/github.com\/certbot\/certbot\">command line <\/a>or plugins (example <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/wp-encrypt\/\">wp-encrypt<\/a>\u00a0for WordPress).

This is the best way to learn.<\/p>\n<p>Setting up the SSL on a web server\u00a0requires certain technicalities such as modifying the vhosts\u00a0file to add redirection code for HTTP to HTTPS. Then adding the paths to the certificates downloaded from\u00a0letsencrypt.org. \u00a0The web server should also be listening on 443 port to make SSL work.\u00a0wp-encrypt plugin can do most of the work itself\u00a0such as downloading certificates\u00a0to the local path and then the user has to follow the steps above.<\/p>\n<p>As of now, this certificate expires every 90 days after which you have to renew it &#8211; either manually from the\u00a0command line (automate it using cron\u00a0job, etc.) or automatically using the plugin.<\/p>\n<p>Search engines worldwide especially <a href=\"http:\/\/webmasters.googleblog.com\/2014\/08\/https-as-ranking-signal.html\">google have started giving more importance to the links with https<\/a> (having SSL layer) protocol, it becomes necessary to switch to SSL, the sooner the better.<\/p>\n<p>One interesting thing about these certificates is they are accepted in all the browser and gets A rating on ssl<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ssllabs.com\/ssltest\/\"> test benchmarks<\/a>.
