  Surveys conducted are anonymous, only type of
  user (home, working, etc.) is askedOur scope is limited to the interaction with
  the refrigerator; very less or no consideration is given to the environment
  in which refrigerator is being used.Survey and Interview sample size is 20-25
  peoples having different level of interactions and use cases with the refrigerator.
  We assumed this sample size is enough for our scope.We are assuming that we are doing all these
  exercises to improve a business position in the market.

  </td></tr><tr><td>
  <strong>4.&nbsp; Results</strong>
  </td></tr><tr><td>
  The main pain areas resulting from user interviews, contextual
  observations, surveys &nbsp;with the
  refrigerator use are:
  The refrigerator is not modular and doesn’t
  suit the containers if they are very large or small.Very painful to every time open the door just
  to see what is there inside and control the temperature.Very difficult to move from one place to other
  to clean it or floor under it.Almost all the participants wanted some indication
  in a display like temperature, capacity, odor level etc.
  
  
  
  The other interesting finding is that customers like
  their brands with their heart and would not like to switch to different brand
  if purchasing a new refrigerator but can reconsider their decision if
  reliability in the form of warranty is provided.
  </td></tr><tr><td>
  <strong>5.&nbsp; Conclusions</strong>
  </td></tr><tr><td>
  The main findings are that user
  (voice of almost all users) wants to save the time while interacting with and
  using the refrigerator. He wants nearly everything to be automated, handy,
  and easy to use with low learning curve. 
  We have suggested few design
  changes and inclusion of new technologies like electronic nose to detect odor
  in the refrigerator and alarming, use of LEDs for saving power and providing uniform
  lighting, inverter technology of using the compressor heat to efficiently convert
  back to electric power and demand based power usage.
  Proposed Recommendations:
  Provision of giving settings controls and
  LCD/LED display outside the refrigerator so the user needs not to open the
  door and bend every time just to check or change the temperature, see inside
  the refrigerator.Transparent Walls with reversible opaque
  capability. Person with the press of switch or remote can switch between
  transparent exterior and opaque exterior.Modular design

<h1><a>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Problem
Statement</a></h1>



<p>Increase satisfaction and ease of use when interacting
with a refrigerator.</p>



<p>The objectives are to observe, interact with the users and
prospective buyers to know their needs and understand their feelings when they
use a refrigerator. Basically, what they see as limitations in their usage and
what things they desire when buying a new refrigerator will be good
opportunities to increase the ease of use and satisfy users.</p>



<h1><a>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Results
and Analysis</a></h1>



<p>To lead in the competition you need to hear and understand the
voice of customers, potential buyers, and all the stakeholders and adapting the
product/business strategies accordingly. The current problem belongs to the refrigerator
market segment and the problem is how we can satisfy variety of users by
delivering better quality and feature rich refrigerator meeting their needs.</p>



<p>For solving this problem, we needed to collect, process the
data of how different types of users use a refrigerator and what features they
see in a refrigerator that they will surely buy if one such refrigerator comes
to the market. We will discuss below how we came to the same frame and thinking
level in which the users were thinking and what recommendations we proposed to
achieve the desired problem objective.</p>



<p>We will walk you through the process that we followed from
connecting with the users, getting their needs to build the solutions. Overview
of the process is given below; detailed steps will be explained in sufficient
depth in this section after the overview.</p>



<ol><li>Understanding the problem and its background</li><li>Planning the journey ahead </li><li>Goal settings for user observations </li><li>Strategy for interviews</li><li>Pre observation data and questionnaire</li><li>Observation</li><li>Debriefing</li><li>Data analysis and categorization</li><li>Finding improvement areas and recommendations.</li><li>Ideation,
evaluation, and prototyping</li></ol>



<p>Let’s discuss these process steps one by one in context of
how we performed them and what artifacts we collected and analyzed at every
step.</p>



<h2>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Understanding problem and its background </h2>



<p>The main purpose of this exercise was to understand the
problem and its context. We have discussed this part in the start of Section 2.</p>



<h2>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Planning the journey ahead</h2>



<p>We planned what exactly we need to
do next and what different steps we have to follow to reach till the solutions.
We discussed in the team that we need to interact with the users in best
possible ways. To achieve this objective we defined our goals and scope under
which we will be interacting with the end users and the stake holders. We
planned to do the team work till the data consolidations and after that
solutions/prototypes will be done individually.</p>



<p>This planning resulted in steps
from 2.3 to 2.10 below.</p>



<h2>2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Goal settings for user observations </h2>



<p>We defined the goals and scope of our
tasks which will guide and keep us on track in the data collection process and
user observations.</p>



<p>Below are the goals we
brainstormed and scoped as our boundary:</p>



<h3>2.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;
Usage type of Refrigerator</h3>



<p>For
example: making ice, water cooling, protecting perishable food items, storing
milk, meat, etc.</p>



<h3>2.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;
Functionality improvements </h3>



<p>For
example: faster cooling, uniform temperature at around all the corners, odor detection
and control, capacity indicator, rotten item indicator, etc.</p>



<h3>2.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;
Design improvements</h3>



<p>For
example: exteriors and interiors, mobility, accessing door, modular design,
noiseless operation etc. </p>



<h3>2.3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;
Reduced energy consumption </h3>



<h3>2.3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;
Understanding types of users (Age, Sex, Culture,
and location wise, etc.)</h3>



<h2>2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Strategy for observation</h2>



<p>We used the following user observation methods explained
with the reasons.</p>



<h3>2.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;
User Interviews </h3>



<p>It can be done in
person or over the phone. It is one of the best techniques because you directly
interact with a user and can interject questions in a dynamic environment.</p>



<h3>2.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;
Participatory observation with context</h3>



<p>To understand things
from the point of view of users and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; making
them feel comfortable that we are there to help them and solve their problems.
You can see them using or working with the refrigerators and observe their
particular way of doing some things and can interject your questions.</p>



<h3>2.4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;
Surveys </h3>



<p>Facebook polls for
getting problems from variety of the users. We received ~10 survey results by
using this method. (Refer Point 4 in Section 2 of Design Study Summary).</p>



<h3>2.4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;
Video</h3>



<p>You get the feel of behavior/dynamic
flow of refrigerator and usage workflow.</p>



<h3>2.4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;
Photos</h3>



<p>You can point to a
particular problem or improvement area. Photos are also useful to give the feel
of environment and layout.</p>



<h3>2.4.6&nbsp;&nbsp;
Focus group</h3>



<p>To collect the pre
observation data with some interacting group. We three participant did the
discussion among ourselves on initial set of questions and basic understanding
of the context.</p>



<h2>2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Pre observation data and questionnaire</h2>



<p>In this step, we identified key contact persons who we will
be contacting for the observation and did some pre research about our users to
prepare some personas.</p>



<p>&nbsp;We also planned and
estimated the time duration during which we will be contacting them or observing
them and scheduled prior meetings with them. Also, based on our goals we
brainstormed some questions to be put in questionnaire. Goal wise questions are

if yes then why?</p>



<h2>2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Observation</h2>



<p>During this period, we observed and interacted with the
users based on our goals, questionnaire, and assumptions. We followed the
observation methods (see section 2.4) as agreed upon. We got the surveys
filled, had interviews with the users, took photo/video shoots of usage and
environment for the data. We planned to meet after the data collection at a pre-determined
time and place. The user problems and stories are given in Appendix B.</p>



<h2>2.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Debriefing</h2>



<p>After we collected the data, we assembled at the place of
meeting and briefed each of us about the tasks each of us performed. We wrote
everything on the paper notes and pasted them on the board. </p>



<p>We also captured the users observed for later consolidation
along with “Let Go” solution provided by the users or us during the observation
period. “Let Go” solutions are basically the solution that comes to your mind
intuitively on the spot.</p>



<p>We followed three steps process for the debriefing.</p>



<h3>2.7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;
Debriefing on the board</h3>



<p>Each person will explain what he has collected and put it on
the board in the proper identifiable and readable manner.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1131"/></figure>



<p>Figure 1 – Debrief Session after observation</p>



<h3>2.7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;
Brainstorming and data consolidation on the board</h3>



<p>Now we as a group went to the board to find the similar
improvement areas and user roles and consolidated them.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1132"/></figure>



<p>Figure 2 – Brainstorming &amp; Prioritization of stories and collected data</p>



<h3>2.7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;
Prioritization of the consolidated on the board</h3>



<p>Everybody assigned priorities to the consolidated items
along with few key users. We did the work of note taking, moderation and work
modeling in this step.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1133"/></figure>



<p>Figure 3 &#8211; Consolidated &amp; prioritized data</p>



<h2>2.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Data analysis and categorization</h2>



<p>After the debrief session and brainstorming, we formed the
categories of the problem areas or improvements area. We also consolidated user
roles (refer to Appendix A) and prepared user profiles (Refer Table 1).</p>



<p>Table 1 – User Profiles</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1134"/></figure>



<p></p>



<h2>2.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Finding improvement areas and recommendations</h2>



<p>Before going for the recommendation for the problems or key
finding, let’s us have some actual refrigerator photos where the problems are
reported.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Compressor and circuits are exposed</strong></li></ol>



<p>Figure 4 clearly shows that compressor and
wires are exposed outside. Compressor is very hot, and exposed wires if cut can
increase the danger of electrocution. We will need to solve this problem for
safety point of view.</p>



<p>Some shield could have provided on the back
side of the refrigerator.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1135"/></figure>



<p>Figure 4 &#8211; Exposed wires and Compressor and unknown things (No labeling)</p>



<ul><li><strong>Time consuming mechanical things like locks</strong></li></ul>



<p>As you can see in the Figure 5 below lock
is provided to safeguard against small kids.</p>



<p>This lock is a simple mechanical lock with
keys, and consumes time to lock and finding keys. This could have been a button
to toggle lock and unlock.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1136"/></figure>



<p>Figure 5 &#8211; Mechanical Lock and Non transparent door</p>



<ul><li><strong>No proper labeling/help</strong></li></ul>



<p>Figure 6 clearly shows a violation in proper
labeling of the circuits and components of a refrigerator. This component
pointed in the figure can be a dangerous thing if unknowingly touched or
overlooked (Well, I don’t know, no label is there).</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1137"/></figure>



<p>Figure 6 &#8211; No Labeling, awaiting possible hazard</p>



<ul><li><strong>Mobility problem</strong></li></ul>



<p>Figure 7 shows an example of the mobility
problem when the refrigerator is placed in the corner and we can’t open its
door fully to pull out a container outside or when somebody wants to clean the refrigerator
inside. This mobility limitation comes in the way again when you want to
displace the refrigerator.</p>



<p></p>

<p>Figure 7 &#8211; No wheels for mobility and Refrigerator environment</p>



<p>We used the conjoint analysis for the evaluating the recommendations.
Check the result section of Design Study Summary or Discussion section 3.5 for
the recommendation we proposed. For detailed recommendation, please refer to
Appendix D.</p>



<h2>2.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ideation, evaluation, and prototyping</h2>



<p>At the end, we brainstormed and discussed among ourselves
and with the users to propose solutions in terms of mock ups or prototypes.</p>



<p>Some of the promising recommendations are given in
section 3.6 for which mock ups and sketches are made. For all the
recommendations you can refer to Appendix D.</p>

<h1><a>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discussion</a></h1>



<p>We have covered the problem and its background in sufficient
depth and breadth in the Analysis section. Please refer to section 2 or Design
Study Summary for more information about problem and its context.</p>



<p>We will see some more insights into the process we followed
from planning to data collection to how we arrived at the solutions. We will
also go through how we captured the data and observed the users. We will
discuss in details the mock ups for the recommendations that we have proposed
and some alternative ways of doing those recommendations.</p>



<p>We are also going to evaluate our assumptions and their
effects on our recommendations and mock ups. </p>



<p>We will also evaluate our mock ups for their pros and cons. Let’s
us first star with the observation methods we decided.</p>



<h2>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Pre observation planning</h2>



<p>We identified the key contacts that we will be communicating
with and at what specified time.</p>



<p>We pondered our attention on who are our users and stake
holder and jolted down few goals for the user samples. We planned well what
will be the size of our samples and that we will pick some users from each of
the following samples:</p>



<ol><li>Age wise (Children, Young, Old)</li><li>Gender wise (Male, Female)</li><li>Culture (City, Village)</li><li>Location wise (Hot, Cold, Rainy, Desert)</li></ol>



<h2>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Observational Methods</h2>



<p>We focused more on contextual observation because it
provides you the context and working condition of the user in its environment
and then you can make yourself aware of the workflow he is following and how he
is interacting with the refrigerator. By getting this information, you can
better observe the user and can find inefficiencies (opportunity areas) in the
workflow or usage.</p>



<p>We received lots of data regarding the modularity when we
were seeing the participants performing their tasks and not using particular
areas for a long time, we interjected on the spot questions that why it is happening,
that gave us more insight for data collection at lower level details.</p>



<p>We had to struggle a bit for getting surveys because people
were avoiding them. But after we convinced them that it is totally anonymous
and no personal information will be recorded, we got few key inputs from survey
participants.</p>



<h2>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Assumptions</h2>



<p><strong>Sample Size: </strong>Our
Sample size is around 20-25, we have included people ranging from villages to
cities, from young to old generation, both genders, novice (villager) and
experts (mechanic), persons from different profession. Though the sample set is
small but it is diverse and we got similar kind of responses from similar user
profiles.</p>



<p>&nbsp;If this assumption of
diversity and reasonable sample size is not met then the data outcome can be
biased in one or two areas, which can affect the recommendations we will give
and it can be deviated from the voice of most of the customers.</p>



<p><strong>Anonymous Surveys:</strong>
We conducted survey anonymously, just asked them what kind of user they are. We
didn’t need any personal data to seek what is the voice of our customers. These
kinds of surveys work when people want to participate and contribute ideas but
don’t want to come outside in front seat.</p>



<p>&nbsp;If this assumption is
not met, then user may feel tracked with their personal information and
psychologically they may not feel comfortable and may not give their full
capacity data due to the mentioned reasons. If this happen, we can only get
very few samples and those can’t be treated valuable as the participation is
not free to think and act.</p>



<p><strong>Refrigerator
Environment:</strong> We have limited our scope with only the interaction and usage
with the refrigerator. We have done very less research on the environment and
workflow around the refrigerator. We have analyzed that these kind of special
conditions and environment use cases are few ones.</p>



<p>But if this assumption is not met, we may observe some voids
in the data related to environment and workflows. Though we have captured some
environments like Canteen Kitchen, Home kitchens, but the study was not
extensive.</p>



<h2>3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Debriefing</h2>



<p>During debrief we assembled at a place of choice and time
that we already agreed upon in planning. This session started with every one
writing their key findings on the different color notes and posting it on the
white board. It was a very interactive session, where each person was talking
about some of the interesting things he found during the observation, while
posting the notes.</p>



<p>Along with our key findings in terms of user needs, we also
captured some environment of refrigerator usage so that we can brainstorm on
design part during brainstorming session. Some user environments were placed on
the board; refer to the column 1 of notes in Figure 1 for more details. Figure
2 and 3 are also part of debriefing sessions; you can refer them for more
insights.</p>



<h2>3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Recommendations</h2>



<p>After the debrief session, on the same day, we collated the
data and prioritized it to focus on the important findings of the user
research. After all the arguments and counter arguments by each team member, we
jolted down the key recommendations. But before we discuss the recommendations,
I would like to walk you through what user were saying about the findings during
interviews, surveys. </p>



<p>Please refer to Figure 12 for the visual representation of
user responses for each category.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1139"/></figure>



<p>Figure 8 – User responses per category</p>



<p>From the Figure 12, it is evident that most users want to
see:</p>



<ol><li>More functionality in their refrigerator, modular
design, they want everything fast and automated about their refrigerator.</li><li>Some kind of visual or sound indication of
refrigerator functioning and running status. </li><li>Exterior is also on users’ priority list because
they want to see and control everything about the refrigerator without the door
every time. </li><li>Users were also having problems with mobility to
easily move and clean the refrigerator.</li><li>Users also wanted some solutions to cope with
odor (rotten food items, taste).</li></ol>



<h2>3.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mockups and Prototyping</h2>



<p>We got the top recommendations as discussed in section 3.5.
I am going to explain in depth the solutions brainstormed and generated with
mockups and drawings.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Modular Design</strong></li></ol>



<p>For making refrigerator more modular and
adaptable is to make adjustable horizontal and vertical dividers so you can get
the flexible space for variety of containers.</p>



<p>Along with this, provision of modular
freezer and vegetables sections can be provided. </p>



<p>Freezer can be pulled out from the top and
can be placed at the bottom and veg section can be placed on the top based on
the season (winter or summer) or as per the usage patterns. There can be a
provision of some button in/control outside the freezer section to convert it into
veg section and vice versa. </p>



<p>Provision of dividing the main door into
numbers of smaller doors can be provided, so to reach to a particular section
of the refrigerator, you need not to open the complete big door. Figure 9
explains the points visually.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-9.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1140"/></figure>



<p>Figure 9 &#8211; Mock up for Modular Design</p>



<ul><li><strong>Transparent Doors</strong></li></ul>



<p>By providing the transparent doors and side
walls for the home use can greatly increase the ease of use and satisfaction of
the buyers because they need not to open the refrigerator every time just to
check if something is placed inside; they can check the things from outside to
better plan. </p>



<p>This concept is being used in super markets
but not penetrated homes yet. Although solution may not sound aesthetic as it
exposes all your things placed in the refrigerator to the outsiders in your
home. The solution for that can be providing some control outside to change the
transparency of door back to opaque and vice versa. Check the Figure below to
get the feel how it will look if implemented.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-11.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1142"/></figure>



<p>Figure 10 &#8211; Mock up for Transparent Doors and sides</p>



<ul><li><strong>Digital display, mobility, help and labels</strong></li></ul>



<p>Figure 11 explains all these needs. Wheels
are provided for better mobility. Wheels can be provided with the locks to fix
the wheels in one place and stopping them from unintentional motion.</p>



<p>For better controlling refrigerator and
knowing its status, some kind of digital LCD/LED display can be provided
outside the door. That will make the tasks easy of controlling temperature
(with options of <sup>o</sup>C or <sup>o</sup>F), humidity from outside without
opening the refrigerator. Along with the controls, this display will also show
the information about refrigerator like its capacity (e.g. 200 Ltr), current
temperature inside refrigerator, odor level or other kind of visual warnings.</p>



<p>Alternate approach for the “outside display”
can be a remote control with inbuilt display. This remote can control the refrigerator
settings and shows its different properties like current temperature, humidity,
odor level, etc.</p>



<p>User help can also be displayed on the
display for easy accessibility. If a hard copy of the help is to be provided, a
help slot can be provided to keep the help book or some other related document
at a handy place. Help can include the topics for example best practices of how
to use a refrigerator efficiently, what kind of things can be put inside the refrigerator
and at what temperature, etc.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-12.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1143"/></figure>



<p>Figure 11 &#8211; Mock up for Display, settings outside, help slot, wheels for mobility</p>



<ul><li><strong>Output ports and light body</strong></li></ul>



<p>“Output ports” is an innovative feature as
shown in Figure 12 below. Output port means that we provide some sort of output
to external containers to cool their contents. It means you are extending your
refrigerator using these output ports through a connecting pipe.</p>



<p>Along with this, disposable fiber glass can
be used for building the non-electrical parts of the refrigerator because this
material is lighter than traditional material, less brittle, flexible and also
doesn’t hurt the environment. This adaptation can ease the movement of the refrigerator.</p>

<p>Problems or improvements in usage or design during
the use of refrigerator faced by you can be shared. Please provide the reason
also for your improvement areas in the refrigerator design and functionality.<br>
For examples: <br>
1. Section of vegetables should be spacious to put more vegetables.<br>
2. Refrigerator door handle is not at a right place.<br>
3. Power consumption is high.<br>
4. Should be fungus proof because i have seen black fungus type inside refrigerator
and it may spoil food.</p>

<p><strong>Home</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>Some types of refrigerator
make much noise. </p>



<p>Old refrigerators
are not disposed-off in correct way. These contain some hazardous gases and
materials that should be disposed correctly.</p>



<p>There should be
separate temperature control for normal section and freezer.</p>



<p>For some types of
refrigerators, back panel becomes very hot which is not good.</p>



<p>Refrigerators
should work\keep inside goods in better condition even when power supply is cut
off. This will help in the areas\cities where there is frequent power cutoff.</p>



<p><strong>Home use</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Refrigerator should
be portable. </p>



<p>It should have
moving wheels.</p>



<p>Tray for collecting
water should be big enough-&nbsp;If there are different doors for separate compartments,
these doors should be see through, transparent so that i know which stuff is
where.</p>



<p><strong>Home Use</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>Back design is not
that good.</p>



<p>Improvement:
Remote Control that can open the door.</p>



<p>Not good use of
space inside it.</p>



<p>Not much resistant
to electrical fluctuations. </p>



<p><strong>Home</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Door should be
transparent to see the things without opening the door.</p>



<p><a>Appendix D &#8211; Recommendations</a></p>



<p>Some
of the proposed solutions are given below.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>1 &amp; 2 Functionality</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. This is the problem, we have
never seen a single refrigerator labeling all the important parts or
connections or circuits.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Help guide for how to use a refrigerator
and its best practices of setting temperature and putting things inside and
how, it can be put in a side slot in the refrigerator that can be easily
accessible.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. If refrigerator has good
large display outside, help guide can be also be provided electronically. </p>



<p>4.
Remote control to open the door or control the temperature or other settings.</p>



<p><strong>3. Exterior
changes\improvements </strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Transparent doors and walls
check the diagram.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can be easily provided but we
need to see the aesthetic effects after that. If we can also provide some
way/button &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to switch between
transparent and opaque walls, then it can be a great ease of use and
interaction.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, we can have camera
installed internally that can display the inside story outside on display.</p>



<p><strong>4. Interior
changes\improvements </strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Modular design, check the
diagram.</p>



<p><strong>5. Inputs/outputs</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Refrigerator can be provided
with ports (like an usb ports) where you can connect compatible pipes to cool
container outside the  refrigerator. This
can extend the refrigerator capacity. But there can be some limitation like to
prevent leaking pipes or containers.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some mechanism should be present
there to detect these kinds of leaks.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is looking promising but we
need to observe the ROI on its research by conducting more exhaustive surveys
and VOCs.</p>



<p><strong>6. Efficient power
consumption</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. We can improve in energy use
by leveraging the current research of inverter technology </p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. If refrigerator is empty then
it should be auto switched off or reduce the energy consumption if the cooling
is needed only &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in specific part or
compartment inside the refrigerator. Can be done easily by using sensors firing
after a certain interval &nbsp;&nbsp; frequency to
check the refrigerator is empty or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. For the display or light
inside we can use,&nbsp; high efficient LEDs,
LEDs consume power of 1/10 of the bulb used inside the &nbsp;&nbsp; refrigerator and provide better light output with less heat
dissipation.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Electric fluctuation can be
avoided by built in stabilizers, many makers have model that have this feature.</p>



<p><strong>7. Indicators</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Can be easily implemented,
refer the diagram.</p>



<p><strong>8. Door</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Door should be slowed down when it is pushed hard
either by mistake or by a child, so not to imbalance the things, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; liquids placed inside it. It can
be easily done using the latest motion suppression and vibration reduction
technologies.</p>



<p><strong>9. Mobility</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mobility can easily be done with balancing and sturdy
wheels that can handle some vibration due to the compressor and motor &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; running. Locks can be provided to wheels to
lock their motion once the refrigerator is installed in the environment.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Customers prefer the brand mobility solution as they
believe them to be of equal quality as the refrigerator is. They don&#8217;t want to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go to the local vendor.</p>



<p><strong>10. Odor handling</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Odor can be handled by placing a sensor detecting some
gases that are released from the rotten things. Beep warning  can be provided to the user along with flashing
visual signal on outer refrigerator display. Electronic nose that detects like &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nose gases like sulphide, ammonia, carbon
monoxide, etc. can be used to detect odor and integrated with microcontroller
logic &nbsp; to send signals for warning (visually
and sound).</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Food taste can be improved with the air flow
regulation/restriction inside the refrigerator. Suggesting the customer best
practices &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to avoid this situation
is a good viable option.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Best Practices:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Always put a lid on your containers with food</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. If some vegetable/fruit/meat is cut, please wrap
in a thin plastic or put in a special container inside the refrigerator for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that purpose.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. We can control the temperature inside the refrigerator
doesn&#8217;t rises too fast or too slow so that &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you
can get your expected temperature setting whenever you want food. This can easily
be achieved by improving the design &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of
the compressor to achieve high cooling velocity. Speed up the cooling gas
liquidation and vaporization using the latest.</p>
