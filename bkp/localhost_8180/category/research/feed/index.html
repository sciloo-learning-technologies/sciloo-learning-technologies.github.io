  Surveys conducted are anonymous, only type of
  user (home, working, etc.) is askedOur scope is limited to the interaction with
  the refrigerator; very less or no consideration is given to the environment
  in which refrigerator is being used.Survey and Interview sample size is 20-25
  peoples having different level of interactions and use cases with the refrigerator.
  We assumed this sample size is enough for our scope.We are assuming that we are doing all these

  The main pain areas resulting from user interviews, contextual
  observations, surveys &nbsp;with the
  refrigerator use are:
  The refrigerator is not modular and doesn’t
  suit the containers if they are very large or small.Very painful to every time open the door just
  to see what is there inside and control the temperature.Very difficult to move from one place to other
  to clean it or floor under it.Almost all the participants wanted some indication
  in a display like temperature, capacity, odor level etc.
  
  
  
  The other interesting finding is that customers like
  their brands with their heart and would not like to switch to different brand
  if purchasing a new refrigerator but can reconsider their decision if
  reliability in the form of warranty is provided.
  </td></tr><tr><td>
  <strong>5.&nbsp; Conclusions</strong>
  </td></tr><tr><td>
  The main findings are that user
  (voice of almost all users) wants to save the time while interacting with and
  using the refrigerator. He wants nearly everything to be automated, handy,
  and easy to use with low learning curve. 
  We have suggested few design
  changes and inclusion of new technologies like electronic nose to detect odor
  in the refrigerator and alarming, use of LEDs for saving power and providing uniform
  lighting, inverter technology of using the compressor heat to efficiently convert
  back to electric power and demand based power usage.
  Proposed Recommendations:
  Provision of giving settings controls and
  LCD/LED display outside the refrigerator so the user needs not to open the
  door and bend every time just to check or change the temperature, see inside
  the refrigerator.Transparent Walls with reversible opaque
  capability. Person with the press of switch or remote can switch between
  transparent exterior and opaque exterior.Modular design

<h1><a>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Problem
Statement</a></h1>



<p>Increase satisfaction and ease of use when interacting
with a refrigerator.</p>



<p>The objectives are to observe, interact with the users and
prospective buyers to know their needs and understand their feelings when they
use a refrigerator. Basically, what they see as limitations in their usage and
what things they desire when buying a new refrigerator will be good
opportunities to increase the ease of use and satisfy users.</p>



<h1><a>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Results
and Analysis</a></h1>



<p>To lead in the competition you need to hear and understand the
voice of customers, potential buyers, and all the stakeholders and adapting the
product/business strategies accordingly. The current problem belongs to the refrigerator
market segment and the problem is how we can satisfy variety of users by
delivering better quality and feature rich refrigerator meeting their needs.</p>



<p>For solving this problem, we needed to collect, process the
data of how different types of users use a refrigerator and what features they
see in a refrigerator that they will surely buy if one such refrigerator comes
to the market. We will discuss below how we came to the same frame and thinking
level in which the users were thinking and what recommendations we proposed to
achieve the desired problem objective.</p>



<p>We will walk you through the process that we followed from
connecting with the users, getting their needs to build the solutions. Overview
of the process is given below; detailed steps will be explained in sufficient
depth in this section after the overview.</p>



<ol><li>Understanding the problem and its background</li><li>Planning the journey ahead </li><li>Goal settings for user observations </li><li>Strategy for interviews</li><li>Pre observation data and questionnaire</li><li>Observation</li><li>Debriefing</li><li>Data analysis and categorization</li><li>Finding improvement areas and recommendations.</li><li>Ideation,
evaluation, and prototyping</li></ol>



<p>Let’s discuss these process steps one by one in context of
how we performed them and what artifacts we collected and analyzed at every
step.</p>



<h2>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Understanding problem and its background </h2>



<p>The main purpose of this exercise was to understand the
problem and its context. We have discussed this part in the start of Section 2.</p>



<h2>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Planning the journey ahead</h2>



<p>We planned what exactly we need to
do next and what different steps we have to follow to reach till the solutions.
We discussed in the team that we need to interact with the users in best
possible ways. To achieve this objective we defined our goals and scope under
which we will be interacting with the end users and the stake holders. We
planned to do the team work till the data consolidations and after that
solutions/prototypes will be done individually.</p>



<p>This planning resulted in steps
from 2.3 to 2.10 below.</p>



<h2>2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Goal settings for user observations </h2>



<p>We defined the goals and scope of our
tasks which will guide and keep us on track in the data collection process and
user observations.</p>



<p>Below are the goals we
brainstormed and scoped as our boundary:</p>



<h3>2.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;
Usage type of Refrigerator</h3>



<p>For
example: making ice, water cooling, protecting perishable food items, storing
milk, meat, etc.</p>



<h3>2.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;
Functionality improvements </h3>



<p>For
example: faster cooling, uniform temperature at around all the corners, odor detection
and control, capacity indicator, rotten item indicator, etc.</p>



<h3>2.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;
Design improvements</h3>



<p>For
example: exteriors and interiors, mobility, accessing door, modular design,
noiseless operation etc. </p>



<h3>2.3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;
Reduced energy consumption </h3>



<h3>2.3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;
Understanding types of users (Age, Sex, Culture,
and location wise, etc.)</h3>



<h2>2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Strategy for observation</h2>



<p>We used the following user observation methods explained
with the reasons.</p>



<h3>2.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;
User Interviews </h3>



<p>It can be done in
person or over the phone. It is one of the best techniques because you directly
interact with a user and can interject questions in a dynamic environment.</p>



<h3>2.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;
Participatory observation with context</h3>



<p>To understand things
from the point of view of users and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; making
them feel comfortable that we are there to help them and solve their problems.
You can see them using or working with the refrigerators and observe their
particular way of doing some things and can interject your questions.</p>



<h3>2.4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;
Surveys </h3>



<p>Facebook polls for
getting problems from variety of the users. We received ~10 survey results by
using this method. (Refer Point 4 in Section 2 of Design Study Summary).</p>



<h3>2.4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;
Video</h3>



<p>You get the feel of behavior/dynamic
flow of refrigerator and usage workflow.</p>



<h3>2.4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;
Photos</h3>



<p>You can point to a
particular problem or improvement area. Photos are also useful to give the feel
of environment and layout.</p>



<h3>2.4.6&nbsp;&nbsp;
Focus group</h3>



<p>To collect the pre
observation data with some interacting group. We three participant did the
discussion among ourselves on initial set of questions and basic understanding
of the context.</p>



<h2>2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Pre observation data and questionnaire</h2>



<p>In this step, we identified key contact persons who we will
be contacting for the observation and did some pre research about our users to
prepare some personas.</p>



<p>&nbsp;We also planned and
estimated the time duration during which we will be contacting them or observing
them and scheduled prior meetings with them. Also, based on our goals we
brainstormed some questions to be put in questionnaire. Goal wise questions are
provided below (for goals refer to section 2.3):</p>

Do you need extra warranty at some extra nominal cost?</p>



<p>Q4. Do you have emotional attachment with your refrigerator,
if yes then why?</p>



<h2>2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Observation</h2>



<p>During this period, we observed and interacted with the
users based on our goals, questionnaire, and assumptions. We followed the
observation methods (see section 2.4) as agreed upon. We got the surveys
filled, had interviews with the users, took photo/video shoots of usage and
environment for the data. We planned to meet after the data collection at a pre-determined
time and place. The user problems and stories are given in Appendix B.</p>



<h2>2.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Debriefing</h2>



<p>After we collected the data, we assembled at the place of
meeting and briefed each of us about the tasks each of us performed. We wrote
everything on the paper notes and pasted them on the board. </p>



<p>We also captured the users observed for later consolidation
along with “Let Go” solution provided by the users or us during the observation
period. “Let Go” solutions are basically the solution that comes to your mind
intuitively on the spot.</p>



<p>We followed three steps process for the debriefing.</p>



<h3>2.7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;
Debriefing on the board</h3>



<p>Each person will explain what he has collected and put it on
the board in the proper identifiable and readable manner.</p>

<p>Figure 1 – Debrief Session after observation</p>



<h3>2.7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;
Brainstorming and data consolidation on the board</h3>



<p>Now we as a group went to the board to find the similar
improvement areas and user roles and consolidated them.</p>



<p></p>

<p>Figure 2 – Brainstorming &amp; Prioritization of stories and collected data</p>



<h3>2.7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;
Prioritization of the consolidated on the board</h3>



<p>Everybody assigned priorities to the consolidated items
along with few key users. We did the work of note taking, moderation and work
modeling in this step.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1133"/></figure>



<p>Figure 3 &#8211; Consolidated &amp; prioritized data</p>



<h2>2.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Data analysis and categorization</h2>



<p>After the debrief session and brainstorming, we formed the
categories of the problem areas or improvements area. We also consolidated user
roles (refer to Appendix A) and prepared user profiles (Refer Table 1).</p>



<p>Table 1 – User Profiles</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1134"/></figure>



<p></p>



<h2>2.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Finding improvement areas and recommendations</h2>



<p>Before going for the recommendation for the problems or key
finding, let’s us have some actual refrigerator photos where the problems are
reported.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Compressor and circuits are exposed</strong></li></ol>



<p>Figure 4 clearly shows that compressor and
wires are exposed outside. Compressor is very hot, and exposed wires if cut can
increase the danger of electrocution. We will need to solve this problem for
safety point of view.</p>



<p>Some shield could have provided on the back
side of the refrigerator.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1135"/></figure>



<p>Figure 4 &#8211; Exposed wires and Compressor and unknown things (No labeling)</p>



<ul><li><strong>Time consuming mechanical things like locks</strong></li></ul>



<p>As you can see in the Figure 5 below lock
is provided to safeguard against small kids.</p>



<p>This lock is a simple mechanical lock with
keys, and consumes time to lock and finding keys. This could have been a button
to toggle lock and unlock.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1136"/></figure>



<p>Figure 5 &#8211; Mechanical Lock and Non transparent door</p>



<ul><li><strong>No proper labeling/help</strong></li></ul>



<p>Figure 6 clearly shows a violation in proper
labeling of the circuits and components of a refrigerator. This component
pointed in the figure can be a dangerous thing if unknowingly touched or
overlooked (Well, I don’t know, no label is there).</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1137"/></figure>



<p>Figure 6 &#8211; No Labeling, awaiting possible hazard</p>



<ul><li><strong>Mobility problem</strong></li></ul>



<p>Figure 7 shows an example of the mobility
problem when the refrigerator is placed in the corner and we can’t open its
door fully to pull out a container outside or when somebody wants to clean the refrigerator
inside. This mobility limitation comes in the way again when you want to
displace the refrigerator.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-7.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1138"/></figure>



<p>Figure 7 &#8211; No wheels for mobility and Refrigerator environment</p>



<p>We used the conjoint analysis for the evaluating the recommendations.
Check the result section of Design Study Summary or Discussion section 3.5 for
the recommendation we proposed. For detailed recommendation, please refer to
Appendix D.</p>



<h2>2.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ideation, evaluation, and prototyping</h2>



<p>At the end, we brainstormed and discussed among ourselves
and with the users to propose solutions in terms of mock ups or prototypes.</p>



<p>Some of the promising recommendations are given in
section 3.6 for which mock ups and sketches are made. For all the
recommendations you can refer to Appendix D.</p>

<h1><a>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discussion</a></h1>



<p>We have covered the problem and its background in sufficient
depth and breadth in the Analysis section. Please refer to section 2 or Design
Study Summary for more information about problem and its context.</p>



<p>We will see some more insights into the process we followed
from planning to data collection to how we arrived at the solutions. We will
also go through how we captured the data and observed the users. We will
discuss in details the mock ups for the recommendations that we have proposed
and some alternative ways of doing those recommendations.</p>



<p>We are also going to evaluate our assumptions and their
effects on our recommendations and mock ups. </p>



<p>We will also evaluate our mock ups for their pros and cons. Let’s
us first star with the observation methods we decided.</p>



<h2>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Pre observation planning</h2>



<p>We identified the key contacts that we will be communicating
with and at what specified time.</p>



<p>We pondered our attention on who are our users and stake
holder and jolted down few goals for the user samples. We planned well what
will be the size of our samples and that we will pick some users from each of
the following samples:</p>



<ol><li>Age wise (Children, Young, Old)</li><li>Gender wise (Male, Female)</li><li>Culture (City, Village)</li><li>Location wise (Hot, Cold, Rainy, Desert)</li></ol>



<h2>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Observational Methods</h2>



<p>We focused more on contextual observation because it
provides you the context and working condition of the user in its environment
and then you can make yourself aware of the workflow he is following and how he
is interacting with the refrigerator. By getting this information, you can
better observe the user and can find inefficiencies (opportunity areas) in the
workflow or usage.</p>



<p>We received lots of data regarding the modularity when we
were seeing the participants performing their tasks and not using particular
areas for a long time, we interjected on the spot questions that why it is happening,
that gave us more insight for data collection at lower level details.</p>



<p>We had to struggle a bit for getting surveys because people
were avoiding them. But after we convinced them that it is totally anonymous
and no personal information will be recorded, we got few key inputs from survey
participants.</p>



<h2>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Assumptions</h2>



<p><strong>Sample Size: </strong>Our
Sample size is around 20-25, we have included people ranging from villages to
cities, from young to old generation, both genders, novice (villager) and
experts (mechanic), persons from different profession. Though the sample set is
small but it is diverse and we got similar kind of responses from similar user
profiles.</p>



<p>&nbsp;If this assumption of
diversity and reasonable sample size is not met then the data outcome can be
biased in one or two areas, which can affect the recommendations we will give
and it can be deviated from the voice of most of the customers.</p>



<p><strong>Anonymous Surveys:</strong>
We conducted survey anonymously, just asked them what kind of user they are. We
didn’t need any personal data to seek what is the voice of our customers. These
kinds of surveys work when people want to participate and contribute ideas but
don’t want to come outside in front seat.</p>



<p>&nbsp;If this assumption is
not met, then user may feel tracked with their personal information and
psychologically they may not feel comfortable and may not give their full
capacity data due to the mentioned reasons. If this happen, we can only get
very few samples and those can’t be treated valuable as the participation is
not free to think and act.</p>



<p><strong>Refrigerator
Environment:</strong> We have limited our scope with only the interaction and usage
with the refrigerator. We have done very less research on the environment and
workflow around the refrigerator. We have analyzed that these kind of special
conditions and environment use cases are few ones.</p>



<p>But if this assumption is not met, we may observe some voids
in the data related to environment and workflows. Though we have captured some
environments like Canteen Kitchen, Home kitchens, but the study was not
extensive.</p>



<h2>3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Debriefing</h2>



<p>During debrief we assembled at a place of choice and time
that we already agreed upon in planning. This session started with every one
writing their key findings on the different color notes and posting it on the
white board. It was a very interactive session, where each person was talking
about some of the interesting things he found during the observation, while
posting the notes.</p>



<p>Along with our key findings in terms of user needs, we also
captured some environment of refrigerator usage so that we can brainstorm on
design part during brainstorming session. Some user environments were placed on
the board; refer to the column 1 of notes in Figure 1 for more details. Figure
2 and 3 are also part of debriefing sessions; you can refer them for more
insights.</p>



<h2>3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Recommendations</h2>



<p>After the debrief session, on the same day, we collated the
data and prioritized it to focus on the important findings of the user
research. After all the arguments and counter arguments by each team member, we
jolted down the key recommendations. But before we discuss the recommendations,
I would like to walk you through what user were saying about the findings during
interviews, surveys. </p>



<p>Please refer to Figure 12 for the visual representation of
user responses for each category.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1139"/></figure>



<p>Figure 8 – User responses per category</p>



<p>From the Figure 12, it is evident that most users want to
see:</p>



<ol><li>More functionality in their refrigerator, modular
design, they want everything fast and automated about their refrigerator.</li><li>Some kind of visual or sound indication of
refrigerator functioning and running status. </li><li>Exterior is also on users’ priority list because
they want to see and control everything about the refrigerator without the door
every time. </li><li>Users were also having problems with mobility to
easily move and clean the refrigerator.</li><li>Users also wanted some solutions to cope with
odor (rotten food items, taste).</li></ol>



<h2>3.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mockups and Prototyping</h2>



<p>We got the top recommendations as discussed in section 3.5.
I am going to explain in depth the solutions brainstormed and generated with
mockups and drawings.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Modular Design</strong></li></ol>



<p>For making refrigerator more modular and
adaptable is to make adjustable horizontal and vertical dividers so you can get
the flexible space for variety of containers.</p>



<p>Along with this, provision of modular
freezer and vegetables sections can be provided. </p>



<p>Freezer can be pulled out from the top and
can be placed at the bottom and veg section can be placed on the top based on
the season (winter or summer) or as per the usage patterns. There can be a
provision of some button in/control outside the freezer section to convert it into
veg section and vice versa. </p>



<p>Provision of dividing the main door into
numbers of smaller doors can be provided, so to reach to a particular section
of the refrigerator, you need not to open the complete big door. Figure 9
explains the points visually.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-9.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1140"/></figure>



<p>Figure 9 &#8211; Mock up for Modular Design</p>



<ul><li><strong>Transparent Doors</strong></li></ul>



<p>By providing the transparent doors and side
walls for the home use can greatly increase the ease of use and satisfaction of
the buyers because they need not to open the refrigerator every time just to
check if something is placed inside; they can check the things from outside to
better plan. </p>



<p>This concept is being used in super markets
but not penetrated homes yet. Although solution may not sound aesthetic as it
exposes all your things placed in the refrigerator to the outsiders in your
home. The solution for that can be providing some control outside to change the
transparency of door back to opaque and vice versa. Check the Figure below to
get the feel how it will look if implemented.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-11.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1142"/></figure>



<p>Figure 10 &#8211; Mock up for Transparent Doors and sides</p>



<ul><li><strong>Digital display, mobility, help and labels</strong></li></ul>



<p>Figure 11 explains all these needs. Wheels
are provided for better mobility. Wheels can be provided with the locks to fix
the wheels in one place and stopping them from unintentional motion.</p>



<p>For better controlling refrigerator and
knowing its status, some kind of digital LCD/LED display can be provided
outside the door. That will make the tasks easy of controlling temperature
(with options of <sup>o</sup>C or <sup>o</sup>F), humidity from outside without
opening the refrigerator. Along with the controls, this display will also show
the information about refrigerator like its capacity (e.g. 200 Ltr), current
temperature inside refrigerator, odor level or other kind of visual warnings.</p>



<p>Alternate approach for the “outside display”
can be a remote control with inbuilt display. This remote can control the refrigerator
settings and shows its different properties like current temperature, humidity,
odor level, etc.</p>



<p>User help can also be displayed on the
display for easy accessibility. If a hard copy of the help is to be provided, a
help slot can be provided to keep the help book or some other related document
at a handy place. Help can include the topics for example best practices of how
to use a refrigerator efficiently, what kind of things can be put inside the refrigerator
and at what temperature, etc.</p>



<p></p>

<p>Figure 11 &#8211; Mock up for Display, settings outside, help slot, wheels for mobility</p>



<ul><li><strong>Output ports and light body</strong></li></ul>



<p>“Output ports” is an innovative feature as
shown in Figure 12 below. Output port means that we provide some sort of output
to external containers to cool their contents. It means you are extending your
refrigerator using these output ports through a connecting pipe.</p>



<p>Along with this, disposable fiber glass can
be used for building the non-electrical parts of the refrigerator because this
material is lighter than traditional material, less brittle, flexible and also
doesn’t hurt the environment. This adaptation can ease the movement of the refrigerator.</p>

<p>Problems or improvements in usage or design during
the use of refrigerator faced by you can be shared. Please provide the reason
also for your improvement areas in the refrigerator design and functionality.<br>
For examples: <br>
1. Section of vegetables should be spacious to put more vegetables.<br>
2. Refrigerator door handle is not at a right place.<br>
3. Power consumption is high.<br>
4. Should be fungus proof because i have seen black fungus type inside refrigerator
and it may spoil food.</p>

<p><strong>Home</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Door should be
transparent to see the things without opening the door.</p>



<p><a>Appendix D &#8211; Recommendations</a></p>



<p>Some
of the proposed solutions are given below.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>1 &amp; 2 Functionality</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. This is the problem, we have
never seen a single refrigerator labeling all the important parts or
connections or circuits.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Help guide for how to use a refrigerator
and its best practices of setting temperature and putting things inside and
how, it can be put in a side slot in the refrigerator that can be easily
accessible.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. If refrigerator has good
large display outside, help guide can be also be provided electronically. </p>



<p>4.
Remote control to open the door or control the temperature or other settings.</p>



<p><strong>3. Exterior
changes\improvements </strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Transparent doors and walls
check the diagram.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can be easily provided but we
need to see the aesthetic effects after that. If we can also provide some
way/button &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to switch between
transparent and opaque walls, then it can be a great ease of use and
interaction.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, we can have camera
installed internally that can display the inside story outside on display.</p>



<p><strong>4. Interior
changes\improvements </strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Modular design, check the
diagram.</p>



<p><strong>5. Inputs/outputs</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Refrigerator can be provided
with ports (like an usb ports) where you can connect compatible pipes to cool
container outside the  refrigerator. This
can extend the refrigerator capacity. But there can be some limitation like to
prevent leaking pipes or containers.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some mechanism should be present
there to detect these kinds of leaks.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is looking promising but we
need to observe the ROI on its research by conducting more exhaustive surveys
and VOCs.</p>



<p><strong>6. Efficient power
consumption</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. We can improve in energy use
by leveraging the current research of inverter technology </p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. If refrigerator is empty then
it should be auto switched off or reduce the energy consumption if the cooling
is needed only &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in specific part or
compartment inside the refrigerator. Can be done easily by using sensors firing
after a certain interval &nbsp;&nbsp; frequency to
check the refrigerator is empty or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. For the display or light
inside we can use,&nbsp; high efficient LEDs,
LEDs consume power of 1/10 of the bulb used inside the &nbsp;&nbsp; refrigerator and provide better light output with less heat
dissipation.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Electric fluctuation can be
avoided by built in stabilizers, many makers have model that have this feature.</p>



<p><strong>7. Indicators</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Can be easily implemented,
refer the diagram.</p>



<p><strong>8. Door</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Door should be slowed down when it is pushed hard
either by mistake or by a child, so not to imbalance the things, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; liquids placed inside it. It can
be easily done using the latest motion suppression and vibration reduction
technologies.</p>



<p><strong>9. Mobility</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mobility can easily be done with balancing and sturdy
wheels that can handle some vibration due to the compressor and motor &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; running. Locks can be provided to wheels to
lock their motion once the refrigerator is installed in the environment.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Customers prefer the brand mobility solution as they
believe them to be of equal quality as the refrigerator is. They don&#8217;t want to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go to the local vendor.</p>



<p><strong>10. Odor handling</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Odor can be handled by placing a sensor detecting some
gases that are released from the rotten things. Beep warning  can be provided to the user along with flashing
visual signal on outer refrigerator display. Electronic nose that detects like &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nose gases like sulphide, ammonia, carbon
monoxide, etc. can be used to detect odor and integrated with microcontroller
logic &nbsp; to send signals for warning (visually
and sound).</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Food taste can be improved with the air flow
regulation/restriction inside the refrigerator. Suggesting the customer best
practices &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to avoid this situation
is a good viable option.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Best Practices:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Always put a lid on your containers with food</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. If some vegetable/fruit/meat is cut, please wrap
in a thin plastic or put in a special container inside the refrigerator for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that purpose.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. We can control the temperature inside the refrigerator
doesn&#8217;t rises too fast or too slow so that &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you
can get your expected temperature setting whenever you want food. This can easily
be achieved by improving the design &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of
the compressor to achieve high cooling velocity. Speed up the cooling gas
liquidation and vaporization using the latest.</p>

<p><g class="gr_ gr_19 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="19" data-gr-id="19">Inspiration</g> for this article &#8211;  <strong>Roberta B. Ness (worked on Ovarian Cancer)</strong></p>



<p>Even though in today’s world we are more eager to invent and do more but innovation in healthcare and many other sectors like water treatment, garbage cleaning etc. is very slow for example there is no cheap cancer treatment, <g class="gr_ gr_105 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="105" data-gr-id="105">cost-effectiveness</g> of other medical treatments, etc.<br></p>



<p>Frames define our thinking, the kind of expectations in a particular situation. Frames are cognitive and emotions expectations and can also result in reactions. For example &#8211; you are expecting a hello from a person meeting you the first time, instead, he tells you who are you?</p>



<p>This breaks the flow or assumptions in your thinking.</p>



<p><strong>Frame</strong></p>



<p style="text-align:left">To innovate &#8211; we must break frames. Scientists used to assume that bacteria can’t grow in acidic environment of the stomach, break this assumptions and check the data to explain anomalies.</p>



<p><strong>Observation</strong></p>



<p>To be an innovator &#8211; you must be a great observer.</p>



<p><strong>Flipping the view</strong></p>



<p>God creates every creature to perfection, Darwin flipped it and said it is not <g class="gr_ gr_29 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling" id="29" data-gr-id="29">perfection</g> and <g class="gr_ gr_40 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="40" data-gr-id="40">lets</g> find the reason for it. </p>



<p>Darwin imagined himself as plant to understand the evolution.</p>



<p><strong>Analogy</strong></p>



<p>What is the cause, cells that are around ovarian are same as in breathing pipe (airway<g class="gr_ gr_10 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation multiReplace" id="10" data-gr-id="10">).</g> Is there can be <g class="gr_ gr_31 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="31" data-gr-id="31">reason</g> that smoking can also affect ovary like our airways.</p>



<p><strong>Élie Metchnikoff </strong>&#8211; the discovery of white blood cell (tried suicide 2 times, believed in Darwin theory). He did put a thorn in a fish and found white blood cells around it to protect from the attack. Read about this great scientist to know of his thinking approach.<br></p>



<p><strong>Be bold not cautious. </strong></p>



<p>World need innovation rather than invention for the sake of patent filing. We need to improve the world and solve problems rather than settle in life.<br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ML not equal to data + black box&nbsp;</p>



<p>ML = data + assumptions&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Free Lunch Theorem</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>As per free lunch theorem, without assumptions we can’t build anything.&nbsp;We can’t have one generic&nbsp;<g class="gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="4" data-gr-id="4">algo</g>&nbsp;that is applicable for all the problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have&nbsp;<strong>constraints&nbsp;</strong>like&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp; assumptions,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp; prior knowledge,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp; domain knowledge&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;when dealing with problems and without considering these how we can solve a problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Data + prior knowledge</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Detection of a person in frame&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a simple approach, we will need many images with person at different location.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But with this knowledge, we can develop transformations to shift a person in the image and then train the model on these images instead of acquiring those images.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We tend to think about Big data that we can develop weak models and can forget the constraints/assumptions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are 2 types of sizes&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp; 1. computation size&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp; 2. statistical size&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1060" width="243" height="198"/></figure></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1061" width="236" height="195"/></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Computationally small but statistical big&nbsp;</p>



<p>Without assumptions, how we can predict a current value for a new voltage value?&nbsp; On the right side, we can take into consideration about V = IR and can be confident that the line is good predictor for future voltage values. This dataset is small in computational size but big in statistical size.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1063" width="384" height="261"/></figure>



<p>Statistically small but computationally big&nbsp;</p>



<p>The above data is computationally big, take a simple example of a <g class="gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="5" data-gr-id="5">black</g> and white image of 10X10 pixel, all the combinations can yield combinations that might be more than the total number of atoms in the universe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unless we make assumptions, it is very difficult to do computation with these big set of images. This above images data can be computationally very large but statistically very small.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Model based ML</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of getting lost in the sea of algorithms/models/research papers, we should use model-based learning to use data and assumptions to derive ML algorithm.&nbsp;We should work mainly on defining our assumptions about the problem very clearly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Machine learning and the learning machine with Dr. Christopher Bishop" width="750" height="422" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9W2BcQyT0ZM?start=695&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Translate your assumptions into a model and that is the core of model-based learning. If our assumptions are sound/strong then we get much more information from the same amount of data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Can we develop a tool to do it automatically? Can this dream be true?&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1064" width="288" height="235"/></figure>



<p><strong>User &amp; Movies</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Predict the question marks – whether a user like or dislike&nbsp;those movie&nbsp;for which he has not given&nbsp;a&nbsp;answer. 10ks of movies, 10Ms of users.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1062" width="433" height="331"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image-5-1024x507.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1065" width="618" height="306"/></figure>



<p>Based on my like or dislike, ML is suggesting movies closer to green area that I can like for sure and closer to red area for movies that I may not like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is learning my behavior and suggesting me titles based on the populations&nbsp;similar to&nbsp;me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Information (as per information theory by&nbsp;Shanon) is the surprise from data. Just like above movie ML&nbsp;algo&nbsp;suggest me movies closer to green area and I pick then there is a very less surprise in the data and suggestions don’t move big.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But instead of liking the movie, if I dislike it, it is a big surprise for the&nbsp;algo&nbsp;and movies suggestions move big.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Quantifying uncertainty</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Uncertainty is an essential part of machine learning and it is a modern view of ML.&nbsp;<strong>Bayes theorem</strong>&nbsp;is at the core of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>BT: P(A/B) = [P(A) * P(B/A)]/P(B)&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Bishop view on Healthcare</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Machine learning and the learning machine with Dr. Christopher Bishop" width="750" height="422" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9W2BcQyT0ZM?start=695&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>It is one of the biggest opportunities but complex also. Personalized healthcare can be a phenomenon suggesting you personalized course of treatment because as an individual each one of us is unique. It is like machine can learn our movies preferences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;This can happen by analyzing the info from other millions of people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp; Cloud based tech + ML tech + Domain experts (from Hospitals like clinicians, doctors, radiologists, etc.)&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Trust and privacy in the Data</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data is encrypted so it is only accessible to those who have keys but It can become vulnerable while being processed. So Microsoft has taken care of processing data in <g class="gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="7" data-gr-id="7">secure</g> vault kind of infrastructure where data can be <g class="gr_ gr_10 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling" id="10" data-gr-id="10">access</g> only to people who have keys. It is secure by hardware and software. </p>



<p><strong>Factor Graph</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image-18.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1120"/></figure>



<p>The probability of getting a circular or triangular cookie depends upon which jar we choose. Round circles on the right sides are &#8211; one random variable for Jar, one random variable for Cookie</p>



<p>These random variables are driven by their respective probability distribution functions (PDFs) denoted as shaded squares.</p>

<p>People don&#8217;t make more mistakes in management from wrong answers to right questions but from right answers to wrong questions, yet people generally spend more time finding the answer than identifying the relevant questions.</p>
<h3>3 Pillars of Startup</h3>
<ul>
<li>Expertise</li>
<li>Resources</li>
<li>Aspirations</li>
</ul>
<p>Should we adapt to find the strategy according to the resources or make the strategy and then identify the resources?</p>
<p>In a technical project &#8211; the priority of the founders and team are restricted by the finances as they are generally limited and way below the requirement. Let&#8217;s see on what principles strategy can be prepared.</p>
<h3>Four Fundamentals of Strategy</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Victory</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your goal must be not to be a marginal competitor expecting to hold 1 or 2% of the market share, it is equivalent to making the ambition marginal and also admitting implicitly that your innovation is not so powerful and attractive.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Build on strengths</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Identify the key strengths of your project/innovation, the characteristics that make it competitive and winning. Look for the points of differentiation which will make the difference with competitors. Invest in these key strengths to increase the difference.</p>
<p>Try to identify the weakness that makes you a real handicap against your competitors and invest to eliminate them and ignore the other weaknesses.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Risk estimation</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Any creative project includes risks, so this is not about eliminating them, but comprehend them and minimise them as much as possible. Dimensions below can be taken into consideration for this.</p>
<p>How reliable can changes in the environment be predicted?</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the degree of technological uncertainty? So, do we see clearly enough through space and time?</li>
<li>What is the degree of flexibility of the project?</li>
<li>Question your own strategy</li>
</ul>
<p>There is nothing worse than to keep going on a strategy that is already known to be doomed. You can&#8217;t win against the market, against the customers, against more powerful competitors.</p>
<p>First, you&#8217;ll try to adapt the project to environmental conditions by redefining:</p>
<ul>
<li>The target customers</li>
<li>The ways to reach them</li>
<li>Changing the business model if needed</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, it is very wise to stop a project at the right time, as instead of wearing yourself out pursuing an elusive goal, you can redirect the energy for a new project. Fail fast is the mantra you should imbibe.</p>
<h3>Market Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Volume Growth vs Value Growth</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The evolution of prices is derived from these two domains &#8211; volume and value. If the market is in volume growth, it is necessary to invest in capacity and financing of working capital. Also, the company should be able to rely on its profitability partially to support the prices.</p>
<p>The growth of a market usually follows an S-curve, it is stable in the start, then accelerate, and then stabilizes in the due course of time.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-987 alignleft" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/growth-300x247.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="247" /></p>
<p>The growth dynamics depend on two phenomena:</p>
<ul>
<li>Penetration</li>
<li>Consumption</li>
</ul>
<p>So the market can grow either by increasing the number of consumers using the product or by increasing their consumption.</p>
<p>Three fundamental questions remain to be answered clearly:</p>
<ul>
<li>How fast will the product get in the market? &#8211; delayed products give the edge to competitors to bring the similar products</li>
<li>Penetration levels at which growth can slow down? &#8211; after that what you should do</li>
<li>On what timescale &#8211; slow or fast?</li>
</ul>
<p>A market is rarely 100% saturated, you can always think about what is the maximum level of penetration that is possible?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Substitution</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, a startup arrives on the existing market with a more or less innovative offer. So it will present a substitute for what already exists.</p>
<p>You may think that your innovation will solve a very important health or safety problem,  customers should rush to buy your offer and leave their old behaviours behind. You will have to manage to substitute your offer to the old one, even if the old behaviour was not present or it was not to do anything. You will have to convince people to change.</p>
<p>The growth of your project will depend on the speed of this substitution. So it is important to understand the obstacles, the reluctances and to deeply analyse the decision-making process of the buyers.</p>
<p>Be aware of the psychological obstacles. Habits are hard to change because the consumers must unlearn a practice that always satisfied him/her and adopt a new technology, a new way of doing that carries risks which are sometimes too important.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Customer Behaviour</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Different kinds of consumers, so many distinct markets, several targets. So you must segment in order to refine the analysis and your business model.</p>
<p>What consequences can a forecasting error have?  Two major consequences appear. On a given date, incomes are not realised. The number of consumers, and so the sales revenue, are way below the forecast.</p>
<p>Pamper your first customers. They will be demanding, but they will help you develop your product, they will make you progress. Furthermore, they will be your most loyal defenders, and often your most effective advertisements.</p>
<p>After your first customers are satisfied or you can say short-term success, at the same time, make the necessary decisions to work with techniques to perfect the development of the product and its offerings, collect funds so that your project can continue and you can work on new ideas or improve the offerings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of us know that Edison holds around 1084 patent but do you know he doesn&#8217;t have the highest number of patents. The highest number of patents at the time of this writings are 5183, almost 5 times than Edison&#8217;s. In this article, I will summarize my learnings from one of such inventors &#8211; Mark Johnson [2] (holds more than 500 patents, but not on the list).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-953 size-full" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/patents.jpg" alt="" width="689" height="457" /></p>
<p>From here on, the article will present as if Mark Johnson is talking to you directly.</p>
<h3>Start</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t learn to be an inventor, I was interested in s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">olving problem, got the first assignment with the deadline of 3 months. I worked for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 months on vibration reduction from the magnetic tape in tape recorder and player. After that, I worked on f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">errite core transformer (having small size but high frequencies) for ~4 years.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nobel prize years</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was working on the similar technologies ( Giant magnetoresistance [3] ) for which- Nobel prize was awarded, this invention had applications in the video recorder, hard disk, etc. and ultimately used to shrink the size of these devices and many more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was important because it is highly sensitive (low magnetic force high resistance change) and gives easy detection.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moores law &#8211; increase in no of inventions per year by Mark</span></h3>
<p>I initially worked on materials and then my organization thought I should focus on display now as we were focussing on TV display or general purpose display in Philips. When we started working on display we got the following.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lcd &#8211; 20 patent</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oled &#8211; 40 patent</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">e-ink &#8211; 100 patents</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Still, we were not leaders in display technologies.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were working on the Flat panel, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low power reflective display and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inventors were leading the planning and executions of these project rather than project management guys. My c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">olleague invented 3 out of 10 display technologies in the market but those were not where we could earn the money for the business. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in AMOLED technology, we were the 2nd company to work out the technology and build the first working model.</span></p>
<p>During these years, I noticed that I was filing patents double than the previous year just like CPU power is doubled every year.</p>
<h3>Paper-like display</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were the first on paper like display &#8211; building the prototype and developing a working technology. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon was taking e-ink display from a company which was using license of this Philips technology (there were 100s of patents) from Philips.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big challenge </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then we needed to come up with next big challenges and after utilizing the experience and literature we came to following topics where work could be done.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neuroscience </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emotions</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reconnaissance</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We needed to work on high-risk high reward ideas but the first step was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hypothesis testing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; fail hypothesis fastest. We picked later different ideas ranging from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food, hair to teeth whitening which was very successful.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Process of inventions</span></h3>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">First scope</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, the idea to implement or patent</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Problems &#8211; how to solve them</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior art &#8211; value of the tech, competitors</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">determine the approach </span>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    No art &#8211; direct patent</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    Some &#8211; workaround</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    Much art  avoid or circumvention (use TRIZ technique)</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find a specific problem that valuable control points</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about 5 to 10 years in future</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evaluate on feasibility, novelty, desirability</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The format of a patent</span></h3>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspiration</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short description</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illustration of invention</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Main tech feature</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Main prior art</span></li>
</ol>
<h3>Advice</h3>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work out of your comfort zone</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">No need to be expert, just do your work</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Material patents are most valuable</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spread out across teams and projects to best spread the process (instead of passive communication or emails)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inexperienced team can be productive with the well laid out process</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be the first to spot and get problems &#8211; snatch opportunities</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listening to the experience of 20-30 years is better than one or two sessions on current technology.</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This article shows one of our founder&#8217;s passion about the art of coffee making and drinking. Firstly, you should recognize that costly equipment will not give you a great cup of coffee if you don&#8217;t put efforts in fine tuning the process that ultimately affects the taste. Just check the video below to get the feel of complete process.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Coffee experiments using bottomless basket portafilter" width="750" height="422" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ijSMLYm2AAo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h3>Coffee making process</h3>
<ol>
<li>Getting coffee (roasted whole bean or grounded)</li>
<li>Grinding</li>
<li>Brewing machine and brewing</li>
<li>Milk frothing</li>
<li>Feeling the taste</li>
<li>Refine the process</li>
</ol>
<p>Lets cover each of them one by one.</p>
<h3>1. Getting the coffee</h3>
<p>This is the first step in the process and can have biggest impact on the taste because  these coffee beans will be brewed and give the taste. Coffee is grown in different parts and heights of the world, this brings a variation in taste across different produce of coffee. Try different coffee beans before you find your taste, take the risk of trying as many as different coffee beans (imagining about the taste and aroma they can produce).</p>
<h3>2. Grinding</h3>
<p>This is also very important step and can impact the taste if you don&#8217;t understand it well. Grinding should be smooth and grounded coffee should be near equal size parts. If we use a normal blade mixer then it will not create a smooth grind, it creates coarse on the top and very fine at the bottom, along with this, it will add a burning taste to the coffee due to the blade friction.</p>
<p>Burr grinders are the most suitable tool as of now for grinding, specifically ceramic burr grinders because they don&#8217;t burn coffee beans. We have used Hario clear grinder which is manual and can be a headache some time when you want quick coffee. There are several automatic coffee grinders in the markets like Bartazza, Delonghi, etc.</p>
<h3>3. Brewing machine and brewing</h3>
<p>Just like other steps, it is also very important step as it involves bringing the actual coffee out from the grounded beans. Machine should provide atleast basic function like prefusion, pressure control, brew temperature control, milk frothing hose.</p>
<p>Coffee machines at the lower price levels come with pressurized baskets which may not be give you the taste as per your liking, so you need to either go for non pressurized machines or make a non pressurized basket by removing the second layer. Prefusion is a very essential step which makes grounded coffee damp so that when the hot water comes after that all the oil from coffee and crema comes easily with the flow.</p>
<h3>4. Milk frothing</h3>
<p>Milk frothing should be done with full steam and cold milk (experts recommend milk with cream without boiling but we got good result from the cream removed milk after boiling and cooling in refrigerator). Bubbles created during the frothing should be removed by tamping the frothing jug or cup on a surface. Milk should look like a smooth creamy flow not a soapy with bubbles (even small also) all around.</p>
<h3>5. Feeling the taste</h3>
<p>After frothing, you can make either latte/cappuccino (depending upon your taste &#8211; add more or less milk) or you can have espresso shot directly. Coffee is best tasted in white small cups with flat or round base. The reason is, in white cup, we can feel the coffee color clearly and it is pleasant to our eyes. During your first sip of the coffee, close your eyes and feel the aroma and taste. Have a healthy discussion on coffee or sit in solace.</p>
<h3>6. Refine the process</h3>
<p>In case you don&#8217;t get your coffee right in first time, repeat the process again with steps fine tuned again till you get a desired taste. As I said in the beginning, it is an art in the sense that you have to feel it to make it right and create a masterpiece every time. It is a science in the sense, to get a good coffee you need to understand the basics of coffee beans, machines, prefusion and why it is necessary, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will add the reference to each steps in coming days in this article. Share your coffee story and the memories and experiences you have about and with coffee.</p>
