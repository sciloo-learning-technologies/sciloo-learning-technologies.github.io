										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wind is moving air and caused by differences in air pressure within our atmosphere or we can say it is the flow of gases on a large scale. Wind is caused by uneven heating of the atmosphere by the sun, variations in the earth’s surface, and rotation of the earth. Mountains, bodies of water, and vegetation all influence wind flow patterns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wind is also used to generate electricity. For the generation of electricity from wind, we use wind turbines. A wind turbine works the opposite of a fan. Instead of using electricity to make wind, like a fan, wind turbines use wind to make electricity. The wind turns the blades which connect to a generator and makes electricity.</span></p>
<p><b>Experiment in Lab:-</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We performed this experiment in our Lab. For wind energy generator experiment we need one dc motor, one LED, one turbine which we rotate with fan or wind.</span></p>
<p><b>Procedure:-</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make a turbine with either a plastic bottle or with cardboard.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Untitled.png" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is Untitled.png" width="164" height="175" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stick the turbine to a stand. Fix the stand on dc motor with both of motor input current points are connected to the LED.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="" src="http://localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Untitled1.png" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is Untitled1.png" width="187" height="167" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, place the turbine in front of the electric fan. As the motor blade rotates, it rotates the shaft of the motor which generates electricity and the LED glows. We will post the video of the experiment soon.</span></p>
<p>Basically, we are converting one form on energy to another (wind to electricity). The magnet inside the motor rotates which induces the current in the motor winding using induction and this induced current give electricity to the connected led.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stargazing is the best part of our workshop. Kids were invited along with parents to share their joy and aha moments. Every child enjoyed the observation of stars and planets. They observed the craters and the surface of the moon. Some planets like Jupiter and moon of Jupiter were shown to the kids and their parents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their excitement and rain of questions and discussions about the earth, the sun, and the universe gave us the happiness we always look for &#8211; the pleasure of finding things out and observing.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Observed stellar objects</strong></h4>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Light is also a form of energy. Light has dual nature which means it behaves like a wave as well as a particle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Light is made up of small particles called photons. Light refers to visible light which human can see. Visible light wavelength lies in between infrared and ultraviolet rays. The main source of light is our sun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Light is basically a combination of seven colours. We can see it using a prism. If light falls on prism it scattered in seven rainbow colours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speed of light is 3,00,000 km/sec. Sun Light takes 8 minutes to reach earth. Different b</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ehaviours of the light are discussed below.</span></p>
<h4><b>Reflection of Light</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When light falls on any object, that object reflects the light to our eyes. That is the reason we can see the object. Take an example of grass, why grass is green. The reason is when light falls on the grass, it absorbs all the colours only reflect back green colour to our eyes. That ‘s why grass appears green.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-575 size-medium" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/reflection-300x130.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="130" /></p>
<h4><b>Refraction of light</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the light enters from one medium to another medium, it appears little bend from its path. This is the refraction of light. Take a transparent glass full of water.if we take a straw and dip the straw into the water it seems to bend but if we take it out it is straight only. So as light is entering from air to water medium it changes its direction.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-576 size-full" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/negative-refraction.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" /></p>
<h4><b>Diffraction of light</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diffraction is bending of a wave around the obstacles and openings. For example, if water is flowing in a river and we put a large stone in the middle so, the stone stops the water path but water will make a new path beside the stone. It means it changes its path. This is called diffraction.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-577 alignnone" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/diffracted-300x196.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="196" /></p>
<h4><b>Solar Eclipse</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar Eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the sun and earth, and the moon fully or partially blocks the sun.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-578 alignnone" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/solar-eclipse-300x114.png" alt="" width="300" height="114" /></p>
<h4><b>Lunar Eclipse</b></h4>
<p>The moon orbits, or goes around the earth. Earth orbits, or goes around the sun. when earth lines up directly between the sun and the moon.when this happens, earth blocks the light from the sun to the moon. Earth’s shadow then falls on the moon. This is an eclipse of the moon. It is called lunar Eclipse.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-579 alignnone" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/eclipse_lunar-300x140.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="140" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gravity is a very interesting topic, its understanding is improving with time from Newton&#8217;s idea to Einstein&#8217;s imagination. In our workshop, we discussed the theory of Gravity according to Newton and Einstein. It was discussed with a demonstration/model about space bending with the help of a rubber/polyethene sheet with a heavy ball in the centre and light ball around it.</span></p>
<p>Also, kids were taught what is a theory and it can change from time to time. Science is a formalisation of observation and reasoning of the observation that can change over time as it happened in the case of Gravity. This thought process is the basis for them to understand why so many different definitions are around on a single concept.</p>
<h4><b>Theory of Gravity as per Newton</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a thought experiment about the apple falling from tree and sky, he thinks there is some magnet kind of force which is attracting apple down. He realised the earth is like a big magnet which attracts everything towards it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If force holding the things is bigger than gravitational force things don’t fall. That is the reason tree can hold the apple or any fruit. But when apple become big or ripe, the holding force become weaker than earth&#8217;s attraction force and the apple fell down.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-565 size-medium" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/13_gravitation1-300x272.jpg" alt="newton gravity" width="300" height="272" /></p>
<h4><b>Theory of Gravity as per Einstein</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Albert Einstein gravity is not an ordinary force but, rather a property of spacetime geometry.Einstein realised that massive objects caused a distortion in space-time. Imagine setting a large body in the centre of a strong fabric which is fixed from the ends. The body would press down the fabric, causing it to dimple or vibrate. If we take a marble rolled around the edge would spiral inward towards the body, pulled in much the same way that the gravity of a planet pulls at rocks in space. Below picture </span>depicts the earth and the moon in a space-time.</p>

<h4>Demonstration</h4>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This model works on the principle of newton’s 3rd law &#8211; EVERY ACTION HAS AN EQUAL AND OPPOSITE REACTION.</p>
<p>As we know for driving anything we need energy. For driving a car, we need fuel (petrol/diesel) or electricity if it is an electric car. But, in this case, our newton’s car extract energy from the balloon&#8217;s air pressure.</p>
<p>Balloon pushes the air out and air pushes the balloon away, which in turn pushes the car and make it travel the distance.</p>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<p>Take an emp<img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-554 size-full" src="http://www.localhost:8180/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Newton_car.jpg" alt="Newton_car" width="320" height="180" />ty plastic bottle. You need to make the car light weight. The tyre of the car should be freely moving. You can join two caps of bottle in opposite direction to give it stability.<br />
Make two holes with the help of a screwdriver, one in the middle of the bottle and other is in the base of bottle perpendicular to 1st hole.<br />
Put one thick pipe across the two holes. The pipe&#8217;s diameter should be big enough to push enough air to generate good amount of force to push the car. Check the bend in the pipe is not too much to block the air flow out.<br />
On the upper end of pipe tie one balloon with the help of rubber band.<br />
Blow the balloon from another end of the pipe and put it down.<br />
You will see as the air come out from balloon it pushes the car in the forward direction which drives our car. Below is the representational picture of how the newton&#8217;s car should look.</p>
<h4>Learnings</h4>
<p>Kids learn the concept of energy and motion. They use their hands-eyes coordination to build a model with a discussion among themselves &#8211; increase their problem-solving skills. They are introduced to Newton, why he is famous, what he did. Kids are told to apply the same principle in different areas like boat, rocket, etc.</p>

<h4>Space in our life</h4>
<p>Nearly everybody is touched by Space in today&#8217;s times and can not deny the excitement when they hear the terms space, Nasa, ISRO, etc. We dream ourselves or our kids going there as scientists or leaders. We always search for opportunity to fulfil this excitement either through the visits of science/technology center (such as <a href="http://www.taralaya.org/">Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium</a>, <a href="http://www.vismuseum.gov.in/">Vishveshwarya Technical Museum</a>, <a href="http://www.hal-india.com/Heritage%20Centre%20and%20Aerospace%20Museum/M__20">HAL</a>)</p>
<h4>Solar System Model</h4>
<p>We always want to have a science kit especially a solar system model all the time to teach our kids about earth, sun, and space. One such model is shown below that is very realistic compared to the models available in the market, it was made using plastic balls and water-colours by our kid. The sun was made with football to mark the size difference. All planets were painted with their distinct surface texture. This model is really useful to demonstrate the different concepts like the solar eclipse, lunar eclipse, planet rotation. See the actual model below.</p>

<h4>Learnings</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This model tells the kids about our solar system, planets, their distance from the sun, orbits, texture of their surfaces. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have eight planets in our solar system which rotates around the sun. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1st four planets Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars are rocky planets being composed of rock and metals. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jupiter and Saturn are called Gas Giants, being composed of mainly hydrogen and helium. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two outer planets Uranus and Neptune are called Ice Giants, mainly composed of ices such as water, ammonia and methane.</span></p>
<h4>Imagination Exercise</h4>
<p>To raise your curiosity, let&#8217;s visualise the scenario that I have written down.</p>
<p>The Earth is constantly rotating around its axis at approx. 1700 km/h. One more interesting thing to know, it is moving in its orbit around the Sun at nearly 107000 km/h. Have you felt this motion ever? And our <span class="highlightNode">solar</span> system is moving in Milky way galaxy at nearly 800000 km per hour. And I am sure on the road you feel scared when moving on a bike or in a car above 100 km/h.</p>

<p>Share your views in the comments &#8211; what do you think about this scenario and did you know it already. What topics you want to cover in this platform, please provide your suggestions.</p>
